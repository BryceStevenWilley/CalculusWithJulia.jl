        "Julia is a freely available, open-source programming language aimed at technical computing.\n\nAs it is open source, indeed with a liberal MIT license, it can be\ninstalled for free on many types of computers (though not phones or\ntablets).\n\n[lauch binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/CalculusWithJulia/CwJScratchPad.git/master)\n\nWe recommend taking advantage of [Binder](https://mybinder.org), which\nprovides a web-based interface to `Julia` built around `Jupyter`, a\nwildly succesful platform for interacting with different open-source\nsoftware programs. Clicking the launch button above will open a web\npage which provides a blank notebook, save for a package used by these\nnotes.\n\n[COCALC](https://cocalc.com/) offers free access to Julia through the\nweb. The free version can be slow due to limits on the resources used,\nbut the monthly price for paid version is modest and the performance\nis quite reasonable.\n\n### Installing Julia locally\n\nBinder is great and convenient, but it may not be the\nbest option. Fortunately, installing `Julia` is a not-so-difficult\noption.\n\n\nBinaries of `Julia` are provided at\n[julialang.org](http://julialang.org/downloads/). Julia has an\nofficial released version and a developmental version. Unless there is\na compelling reason, the latest released version should be downloaded\nand installed for use.\n\nThe base `Julia` provides a *command-line interface*, or REPL\n(read-evaluate-parse).\n\n### Basic interactive usage\n\nOnce installed, `Julia` can be started by clicking on an icon or\ntyping `julia` at the command line. Either will open a *command line\ninterface* for a user to interact with a `Julia` process. The basic\nworkflow is easy: commands are typed then sent to a `Julia` process\nwhen the \"return\" key is pressed for a complete expression. Then the\noutput is displayed.\n\n\nA command is typed following the *prompt*. An example might be `2 + 2`. To send the command to the `Julia` interpreter the \"return\" key is pressed. A complete expression or expressions will then be parsed and evaluated (executed). If the expression is not complete, `julia`'s prompt will still accept input to complete the expression. Type `2 +` to see. (The expression `2 +` is not complete, as the infix operator `+` expects two arguments, one on its left and one on its right.)"
