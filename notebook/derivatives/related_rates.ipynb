        "In the second case we have a different shape. The graph is not\nmonotonic, and before the peak there is an inflection point.  Without\nthinking too hard, we can see that the greatest change in the angle is\nwhen it is just above the head ($t=2$ has $x(t)=100$).\n\nThat these two graphs differ so, means that the player may be able to\nread if the ball is going to go over his or her head by paying\nattention to the how the ball is being tracked.\n\n##### Example\n\nHipster pour-over coffee is made with a conical coffee filter. The\ncone is actually a [frustum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frustum) of\na cone with small diameter, say $r_0$ chopped off. We will parameterize\nour cone by a value $h \\geq 0$ on the $y$ axis and an angle $\\theta$\nformed by a side and the $y$ axis. Then the coffee filter is the part\nof the cone between some $h_0$ (related  $r_0=h_0 \\tan(\\theta)$) and $h$.\n\nThe volume of a cone of height $h$ is $V(h) = \\pi/3 h \\cdot\nR^2$. From the geometry, $R = h\\tan(\\theta)$. The volume of the\nfilter then is:\n\n$$~\nV = V(h) - V(h_0).\n~$$\n\nWhat is $dV/dh$ in terms of $dR/dh$?\n\nDifferentiating implicitly gives:\n\n\n$$~\n\\frac{dV}{dh} = \\frac{\\pi}{3} ( R(h)^2 + h \\cdot 2 R \\frac{dR}{dh}).\n~$$\n\nWe see that it depends on $R$ and the change in $R$ with respect to $h$. However, we visualize $h$ - the height - so it is better to re-express. Clearly, $dR/dh = \\tan\\theta$ and using $R(h) = h \\tan(\\theta)$ we get:\n\n$$~\n\\frac{dV}{dh} = \\pi h^2 \\tan^2(\\theta).\n~$$\n\nThe rate of change goes down as $h$ gets smaller ($h \\geq h_0$) and gets bigger for bigger $\\theta$.\n\nHow do the quantities vary in time?\n\nFor an incompressible fluid, by balancing the volume leaving with how\nit leaves we will have $dh/dt$ is the ratio of the cross-sectional\narea at bottom over that at the height of the fluid $(\\pi \\cdot (h_0\\tan(\\theta))^2) /\n(\\pi \\cdot ((h\\tan\\theta))^2)$ times the outward velocity of the fluid.\n\nThat is $dh/dt = (h_0/h)^2 \\cdot v$. Which makes sense - larger openings\n($h_0$) mean more fluid lost per unit time so the height change\nfollows, higher levels ($h$) means the change in height is slower, as\nthe cross-sections have more volume.\n\n\nBy [Torricelli's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torricelli's_law) law,\nthe out velocity follows the law $v = \\sqrt{2g(h-h_0)}$. This gives:\n\n$$~\n\\frac{dh}{dt} = \\frac{h_0^2}{h^2} \\cdot v = \\frac{h_0^2}{h^2} \\sqrt{2g(h-h_0)}.\n~$$\n\nIf $h >> h_0$, then $\\sqrt{h-h_0} = \\sqrt{h}\\sqrt(1 - h_0/h) \\approx \\sqrt{h}(1 - (1/2)(h_0/h)) \\approx \\sqrt{h}$. So the rate of change of height in time is like $1/h^{3/2}$.\n\n\nNow, by the chain rule, we have then the rate of change of volume with respect to time, $dV/dt$, is:\n\n$$~\n\\frac{dV}{dt} =\n\\frac{dV}{dh} \\cdot \\frac{dh}{dt} =\n\\pi h^2 \\tan^2(\\theta) \\cdot \\frac{h_0^2}{h^2} \\sqrt{2g(h-h_0)} =\n\\pi \\sqrt{2g} \\cdot (r_0)^2 \\cdot \\sqrt{h-h_0}\n\\approx \\pi \\sqrt{2g} \\cdot r_0^2 \\cdot \\sqrt{h}\n~$$\n\n\n\nThis rate depends on the square of the size of the\nopening ($r_0^2$) and the square root of the height ($h$), but not the\nangle of the cone.\n\n## Questions\n\n###### Question\n\nSupply and demand.
