        "This is off by about $3$ percent. Not so bad for some applications, devastating for others.\n\n##### Example from physics\n\nA *simple* pendulum is comprised of a massless \"bob\" on a rigid \"rod\"\nof length $l$. The rod swings back and forth making an angle $\\theta$\nwith the perpendicular. At rest $\\theta=0$, here we have $\\theta$ swinging with $\\lvert\\theta\\rvert \\leq \\theta_0$\nfor some $\\theta_0$.\n\nAccording to [Wikipedia](http://tinyurl.com/yz5sz7e) - and many\nintroductory physics book - while swinging, the angle $\\theta$ varies\nwith time following this equation:\n\n$$~\n\\theta''(t) + \\frac{g}{l} \\sin(\\theta(t)) = 0.\n~$$\n\nThat is, the second derivative of $\\theta$ is proportional to the sine\nof $\\theta$ where the proportionality constant involves $g$ from\ngravity and the length of the \"rod.\"\n\nThis would be much easier if the second derivative were proportional to the angle $\\theta$ and not its sine.\n\n[Huygens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christiaan_Huygens) used the\napproximation of $\\sin(x) \\approx x$, noted above, to say that when\nthe angle is not too big, we have the pendulum's swing obeying\n$\\theta''(t) = -g/l \\cdot t$. Without getting too involved in why,\nwe can verify by taking two derivatives that $\\theta_0\\sin(\\sqrt{g/l}\\cdot t)$ will be a solution to this\nmodified equation.\n\nThis says the motion is periodic with constant amplitude (assuming frictionless behaviour), as\nthe sine function is. More surprisingly, the period is found from $T =\n2\\pi/(\\sqrt{g/l}) = 2\\pi \\sqrt{l/g}$. It depends on $l$ - longer\n\"rods\" take more time to swing back and forth - but does not depend\non the how wide the pendulum is swinging between (provided $\\theta_0$\nis not so big the approximation of $\\sin(x) \\approx x$ fails). This\nlatter fact may be surprising, though not to Galileo who discovered\nit.\n\n\n\n\n## The actual error\n\nHow good is the approximation? Graphically we can see it is pretty\ngood for the graphs we choose, but are there graphs out there for\nwhich the approximation is not so good?  Of course. However, we can\nsay this (the\n[Lagrange](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor%27s_theorem) form of a\nmore general Taylor remainder theorem):\n\n> Let $f(x)$ be twice differentiable on $I=(a,b)$, and $a < c <\n> b$. Then for any $x$ in $I$, there exists some value $\\xi$ between $c$  and $x$ such that\n> $$~f(x) = f(c) + f'(c)(x-c) + f''(\\xi)\\cdot(x-c)^2/2.~$$\n\nThat is, the error is basically a constant depending on the concavity\nof $f$ times a quadratic function centered at $c$.\n\nFor $\\sin(x)$ at $c=0$ we get $\\lvert\\sin(x) - x\\rvert = \\lvert-\\sin(\\xi)\\cdot x^2/2\\rvert$.\nSince $\\lvert\\sin(\\xi)\\rvert \\leq 1$, we must have this bound:\n$\\lvert\\sin(x) - x\\rvert \\leq x^2/2$.\n\n\nCan we verify?

But what is the $\\mathcal{O}(x^2)$?\n\nWe know the answer is *precisely* $f''(\\xi)/2 \\cdot x^2$, but were we\nonly concerned about the scale as $x$ goes to zero we would say this\nis some well-behaved value (converging to $1 - f''(0)/2$) times\n$x^2$.

A little \"oh\" (e.g., $\\mathcal{o}(x^2)$) would mean\nthat limit would be $0$.\n\nBig \"oh\" and little \"oh\" give us a sense of how good an approximation\nis without being bogged down in the details of the exact value. As\nsuch they are useful guides in focusing on what is primary and what is\nsecondary. Applying this to our case, we have this rough form of the\ntangent line approximation valid for functions having a second\nderivative:\n\n$$~\nf(x) = f(c) + f'(c)(x-c) + \\mathcal{O}((x-c)^2).\n~$$\n\n##### Example: the algebra of tangent line approximations\n\nSuppose $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are represented by their tangent lines about $c$, respectively:\n\n$$~\nf(x) = f(c) + f'(c)(x-c) + \\mathcal{O}((x-c)^2), \\quad\ng(x) = g(c) + g'(c)(x-c) + \\mathcal{O}((x-c)^2).\n~$$\n\nConsider the sum, after rearranging we have:\n\n$$~\n\\begin{align}\nf(x) + g(x) &=  f(c) + f'(c)(x-c) + \\mathcal{O}((x-c)^2) + g(c) + g'(c)(x-c) + \\mathcal{O}((x-c)^2)\\\\\n&= (f(c) + g(c)) + (f'(c)+g'(c))(x-c) + \\mathcal{O}((x-c)^2).\n\\end{align}\n~$$\n\nThe two big \"Oh\" terms become just one as the sum of a constant times $(x-c)^2$ plus a constant time $(x-c)^2$ is just some other constant times $(x-c)^2$. What we can read off from this is the term multiplying $(x-c)$ is just the derivative of $f(x) + g(x)$ (from the sum rule), so this too is a tangent line approximation.\n\n\nIs it a coincidence that s basic algebraic operation wit tangent lines approximations produces a tangent line approximation? Let's try multiplication:\n\n$$~\n\\begin{align}\nf(x) \\cdot g(x) &=  [f(c) + f'(c)(x-c) + \\mathcal{O}((x-c)^2)] \\cdot [g(c) + g'(c)(x-c) + \\mathcal{O}((x-c)^2)]\\\\\n&=[(f(c) + f'(c)(x-c)] \\cdot  [g(c) + g'(c)(x-c)] + (f(c) + f'(c)(x-c) \\cdot \\mathcal{O}((x-c)^2)) + g(c) + g'(c)(x-c) \\cdot \\mathcal{O}((x-c)^2)) + [\\mathcal{O}((x-c)^2))]^2\\\\\n&= [(f(c) + f'(c)(x-c)] \\cdot  [g(c) + g'(c)(x-c)] + \\mathcal{O}((x-c)^2)\\\\\n&= f(c) \\cdot g(c) + [f'(c)\\cdot g(c) + f(c)\\cdot g'(c)] \\cdot (x-c) + [f'(c)\\cdot g'(c) \\cdot (x-c)^2 + \\mathcal{O}((x-c)^2)] \\\\\n&= f(c) \\cdot g(c) + [f'(c)\\cdot g(c) + f(c)\\cdot g'(c)] \\cdot (x-c) + \\mathcal{O}((x-c)^2)\n\\end{align}\n~$$\n\nThe big \"oh\" notation just sweeps up many things including any products of it *and* the term $f'(c)\\cdot g'(c) \\cdot (x-c)^2$. Again, we see from the product rule that this is just a tangent line approximation for $f(x) \\cdot g(x)$.\n\nIn conclusion, basic mathematical operations involving tangent lines can be computed just using the tangent lines when the desired accuracy is at the tangent line level. This is even true for composition, though there the outer and inner functions may have different \"$c$\"s.\n\nKnowing this can simplify the task of finding tangent line approximations of compound expressions.\n\nFor example, suppose we know that at $c=0$ we have these formula where $a \\approx b$ is a shorthand for the more formal $a=b + \\mathcal{O}(x^2)$:\n\n$$~\n\\sin(x) \\approx x, \\quad e^x \\approx 1 + x, \\quad \\text{and}\\quad 1/(1+x) \\approx 1 - x.\n~$$\n\nThen we can immediately see these tangent line approximations about $x=0$:\n\n\n$$~\ne^x \\cdot \\sin(x) \\approx (1+x) \\cdot x = x + x^2 \\approx x,\n~$$\n\nand\n\n$$~\n\\frac{\\sin(x)}{e^x} \\approx \\frac{x}{1 + x} \\approx x \\cdot(1-x) = x-x^2 \\approx x.\n~$$\n\n\nSince $\\sin(0) = 0$, we can use these to find the tangent line approximation of\n\n$$~\ne^{\\sin(x)} \\approx e^x \\approx 1 + x.\n~$$\n\n\nNote that $\\sin(\\exp(x))$ is approximately $\\sin(1+x)$ but not approximately $1+x$, as the expansion for $\\sin$ about $1$ is not simply $x$.\n\n\n\n\n## Questions\n\n###### Question\n\nWhat is the right linear approximation for $\\sqrt{1 + x}$ near $0$?"
