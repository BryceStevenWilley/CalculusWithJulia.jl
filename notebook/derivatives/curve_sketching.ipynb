        "Though this approach is most useful for hand-sketches, the underlying\nconcepts are important for properly framing graphs made with the\ncomputer.\n\nWe can easily make a graph of a function over a specified\ninterval. What is not always so easy is to pick an interval that shows\noff the feature of interest. In the section on\n[rational](../precalc/rational_functions.html) functions there was a\ndiscussion about how to draw graphs for rational functions so that\nhorizontal and vertical asymptotes can be seen. These are properties\nof the \"large.\" In this section, we build on this, but concentrate now\non more local properties of a function.\n\n\n## Positive and increasing on an interval\n\nBefore beginning, we need some vocabulary:\n\n> A function $f$ is *positive* on an interval $I$ if for any $a$ in $I$ it must be that $f(a) > 0$.\n\nOf course, we  define *negative* in a parallel manner. The intermediate value theorem says a continuous function can not change from positive to negative without crossing $0$. This is not the case for functions with jumps, of course.\n\n> A function, $f$, is (strictly) *increasing* on an interval $I$ if for any $a < b$ it must be that $f(a) < f(b)$.\n\nThe word strictly is related to the inclusion of the $<$ precluding the possibility of a function being flat over an interval that the $\\leq$ inequality would allow.\n\nA parallel definition with $a < b$ implying $f(a) > f(b)$ would be used for a *strictly decreasing* function.\n\n\nWe can try and prove these properties for a function algebraically -\nwe'll see both are related to the zeros of some function, but, as with\nmost problems, However, before proceeding to that it is usually\nhelpful to get an idea of where the answer is using exploratory\ngraphs.\n\nThis helper function plots the function `f` twice: the second time\nonly when the second function `g` is positive."

        "Maybe surprisingly, we see that the increasing parts of the sine curve are now\nhighlighted. Of course, the cosine is the derivative of the sine\nfunction, now we discuss that this is no coincidence.\n\nFor the sequel, we will use `f'` notation to find numeric derivatives, with the notation being defined in the `CalculusWithJulia` package using the `ForwardDiff` package.\n\n\n## Relative extrema\n\nWhen a function changes from increasing to decreasing, or decreasing to increasing, it will have a peak or a valley. We call such points relative extrema. A definition may be:\n\n> The function $f(x)$ has a *relative  maximum* at $x$ if the value $f(x)$ is an *absolute maximum* for some open interval containing $x$. Similarly, a *relative minimum* is defined.\n\nIf $x$ is a relative maximum, then there is some $a < x < b$ with $f(u) \\leq f(x)$ for any $u \\in (a,b)$. This does not say there is an absolute maximum over any interval $I$ at $x$, but rather there is some (open) interval for which $f(x)$ is an absolute maximum.\n\n\n[Fermat's](http://tinyurl.com/nfgz8fz) theorem implies that any local\nextrema must occur at a critical point of the function $f(x)$.\n\n\n\n## The relationship of the derivative and increasing\n\nThe derivative, $f'(x)$, computes the slope of the tangent line to the\ngraph of $f(x)$ at the point $(x,f(x))$. If the derivative is\npositive, the tangent line will have an increasing slope. Clearly if\nwe see an increasing function and mentally layer on a tangent line, it will\nhave a positive slope. Intuitively then, increasing functions and\npositive derivatives are related concepts. But there are some\ntechnicalities.\n\nSuppose $f(x)$ has a derivative on $I$ . Then\n\n> If $f'(x)$ is positive on an interval $I=(a,b)$, then $f(x)$ is strictly increasing on $I$.\n\nMeanwhile,\n\n> If a function $f(x)$ is increasing on $I$, then $f'(x) \\geq 0$.\n\nThe technicality being the equality parts. In the second statement, we\nhave the derivative is non-negative, as we can't guarantee it is\npositive, even if we considered just strictly increasing functions.\n\nWe can see by the example of $f(x) = x^3$ that strictly increasing\nfunctions can have a zero derivative, at a point.\n\nThe mean value theorem provides the reasoning behind the first statement: on\n$I$, the slope of any secant line between $d < e$ (both in $I$) is matched by the slope of some\ntangent line, which by assumption will always be positive. If the\nsecant line slope is written as $(f(e) - f(d))/(e - d)$ with $d < e$,\nthen it is clear then that $f(e) - f(d) > 0$, or $f(e) > f(d)$.\n\nThe second part, follows from the secant line equation. The derivative\ncan be written as a limit of secant-line slopes, each of which is\npositive. The limit of positive things can only be non-negative,\nthough there is no guarantee the limit will be positive.\n\n\nSo, to visualize where a function is increasing, we can just pass in\nthe derivative as the masking function in our `plotif` function, as long as we are wary about places with $0$ derivative (flat spots).\n\nFor example, here we see where a more complicated function is\nincreasing by passing in its derivative to `plotif`:"

        "### First derivative test\n\nWe know since Fermat that relative maxima and minima occur at\n*critical* points. But what is **not** true is that all critical points\ncorrespond to relative maxima and minima. Again, $f(x)=x^3$ provides\nthe example at $x=0$. This is a critical point, but clearly not a\nrelative maximum or minimum - it is just a slight pause for a\nstrictly increasing function.\n\nWhen will a critical point correspond to a relative maximum or minimum? That\nquestion can be answered by considering the first derivative.\n\n> *The first derivative test*: If $c$ is a critical point for $f(x)$ and\n> *if* $f'(x)$ changes sign at $x=c$, then $f(c)$ will be either a\n> relative maximum or a relative minimum. It will be a relative maximum if the\n> derivative changes sign from $+$ to $-$ and a relative minimum if the\n> derivative changes sign from $-$ to $+$. If $f'(x)$ does not change sign\n> at $c$, then $(c,f(c))$ is *not* a relative maximum or minimum.\n\nThe classification part, should be clear: e.g., if the derivative is positive then\nnegative, the function $f$ will increase to $(c,f(c))$ then decrease\nfrom $(c,f(c))$ - so a local maximum.\n\nOur definition of critical point *assumes* $f(c)$ exists, as $c$ is in\nthe domain of $f$. With this assumption, vertical asymptotes are\navoided. However, it need not be that $f'(c)$ exists. The absolute\nvalue function at $x=0$ provides an example: this point is a critical\npoint where the derivative changes sign, but is not defined exactly at\n$x=0$. Regardless, it is guaranteed that $(c,f(c))$ will be a relative\nminimum by the first derivative test.\n\n##### Example\n\nConsider the function $f(x) = e^{-\\lvert x\\rvert} \\cos(\\pi x)$ over $[-3,3]$:"

        "##### Example\n\nSuppose you know $f'(x) = (x-1)\\cdot(x-2)\\cdot (x-3) = x^3 - 6x^2 +\n11x - 6$ and $g'(x) = (x-1)\\cdot(x-2)^2\\cdot(x-3)^3 = x^6 -14x^5\n+80x^4-238x^3+387x^2-324x+108$.\n\nHow would the graphs of $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ differ, as they share identical critical points?\n\nThe graph of $f(x)$ - a function we do not have a formula for - can have its critical points characterized by the first derivative test. As the derivative changes sign at each, all critical points correspond to relative maxima. The sign pattern is negative/positive/negative/positive so we have from left to right a relative minimum, a relative maximum, and then a relative minimum.\n\nFor the graph of $g(x)$ we can apply the same analysis. Thinking for a\nmoment, we see as the factor $(x-2)^2$ comes as a power of $2$, the\nderivative of $g(x)$ will not change sign at $x=2$, so there is no\nrelative extreme value there. However, at $x=3$ the factor has an odd\npower, so the derivative will change sign at $x=3$. So, as $g'(x)$ is\npositive for large *negative* values, there will be a relative maximum\nat $x=1$ and, as $g'(x)$ is positive for large *positive* values, a\nrelative minimum at $x=3$.\n\nThe latter is consistent with a $7$th degree polynomial with positive leading coefficient. It is intuitive that since $g'(x)$ is a $6$th degree polynomial, $g(x)$ will be a $7$th degree one, as the power rule applied to a polynomial results in a polynomial of lesser degree by one.\n\n## Concavity\n\nConsider the function $f(x) = x^2$.

Let $I$ be an open interval.\n\n> **Concave up**: A function $f(x)$ is concave up on $I$ if for any $a < b$ in $I$, the secant line between $a$ and $b$ lies above the graph of $f(x)$ over $[a,b]$.\n\nA similar definition exists for *concave down* where the secant lines\nlie below the graph.  Notationally, concave up says $f(a) + (f(b) -\nf(a))/(b-a) \\cdot (x-a) \\geq f(x)$ for any $x$ in $[a,b]$.  Replacing\n$\\geq$ with $\\leq$ defines *concave up*, and with either $>$ or $<$\nwill add the prefix \"strictly.\" These definitions are useful for a\ngeneral definition of\n[convex functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_function).  We\nwon't work with these definitions, rather we will characterize\nconcavity for functions which have either a first or second\nderivative.\n\n> If $f'(x)$ exists and is *increasing* on $(a,b)$ then $f(x)$ is concave up on $(a,b)$.\n\nA proof of this makes use of the same trick used to establish the mean\nvalue theorem from Rolle's theorem. Let $g(x) = f(x) - (f(a) + M \\cdot\n(x-a)$, where $M$ is the slope of the secant line between $a$ and\n$b$. By construction $g(a) = g(b) = 0$. If $f'(x)$ is increasing, then\nso is $g'(x) = f'(x) + M$. Concave up means $g(x) \\leq 0$. Suppose to\nthe contrary that there is a value where $g(x) > 0$ in $[a,b]$. We\nshow this can't be. Assuming $g'(x)$ always exists, after some work,\nRolle's theorem will ensure there is a value where $g'(c) = 0$ and\n$(c,g(c))$ is a relative maximum, and as we know there is at least one\npositive value, it must be $g(c) > 0$. The first derivative test then\nensures that $g'(x)$ will increase to the left of $c$ and decrease to\nthe right of $c$, since $c$ is at a critical point and not an\nendpoint. But this can't happen as $g'(x)$ is assumed to be increasing\non the interval.\n\nSimilarly, if a function has a decreasing derivative on $I$ then it\nwill be concave down on $I$.\n\n\nThe relationship between increasing functions and their derivatives - if $f'(x) > 0 $ on $I$ it is increasing on $I$ - \ngives this second characterization of concavity when the second\nderivative exists:\n\n> If $f''(x)$ exists and is positive on $I$, then $f(x)$ is concave up on $I$.\n\nThis follows,  as we can think of $f''(x)$ as just the first derivative\nof the function $f'(x)$, so the assumption will force $f'(x)$ to exist and be\nincreasing, and hence $f(x)$ to be concave up.\n\n##### Example\n\nLet's look at the function $x^2 \\cdot e^{-x}$ for positive $x$.
