        "Let's return to limits of the form $f(x)/g(x)$ which have an\nindeterminate form of $0/0$ if both are evaluated at $c$. The typical\nexample being the limit considered by Euler:\n\n$$~\n\\lim_{x\\rightarrow 0} \\frac{\\sin(x)}{x}.\n~$$\n\nWe know this is $1$ using a bound from geometry, but might also guess\nthis is one, as we know from linearization near $0$ that we have\n\n$$~\n\\sin(x) = x - \\sin(\\xi)x^2/2, \\quad 0 < \\xi < x.\n~$$\n\nThis would yield:\n\n$$~\n\\lim_{x \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{\\sin(x)}{x} = \\lim_{x\\rightarrow 0} \\frac{x -\\sin(\\xi) x^2/2}{x} = \\lim_{x\\rightarrow 0} 1 + \\sin(\\xi) \\cdot x/2 = 1.\n~$$\n\nThis is because we know $\\sin(\\xi) x/2$  has a limit of $0$, when $|\\xi| \\leq |x|$.\n\nThat doesn't look any easier, as we worried about the error term, but\nif just mentally replaced $\\sin(x)$ with $x$ - which it basically is\nnear $0$ - then we can see that the limit should be the same as $x/x$\nwhich we know is $1$ without thinking.\n\n\nBasically, we found that in terms of limits, if both $f(x)$ and $g(x)$\nare $0$ at $c$, that we *might* be able to just take this limit:\n$(f(c) + f'(c) \\cdot(x-c)) / (g(c) + g'(c) \\cdot (x-c))$ which is just\n$f'(c)/g'(c)$.\n\nWouldn't that be nice? We could find difficult limits just by\ndifferentiating the top and the bottom at $c$ (and not use the messy quotient rule).\n\n\nWell, in fact that is more or less true, a fact that dates back to\n[L'Hospital](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27H%C3%B4pital%27s_rule) -\nwho wrote the first textbook on differential calculus - though this result is\nlikely due to one of the Bernoulli brothers.\n\n> **L'Hospital's rule**: Suppose, $f$ and $g$ are differentiable in $(a,b)$\n> with $a < c < b$. Moreover, suppose $|g(x)| > 0$ for all $x$ in $(a,b)$ except\n> at $c$. Further suppose $f(c)=g(c) =0$. If $\\lim_{x\\rightarrow\n> c}f'(x)/g'(x)=L$ (the limit exists), then $L = \\lim_{x \\rightarrow\n> c}f(x)/g(x)$.\n\nThat is *if* the limit of $f(x)/g(x)$ is indeterminate of the form $0/0$,\nbut the limit of $f'(x)/g'(x)$ is known, possibly by simple\ncontinuity, then the limit of $f(x)/g(x)$ exists and is equal to that\nof $f'(x)/g'(x)$.\n\nTo apply this rule to Euler's example, $\\sin(x)/x$, we just need to consider that:\n\n$$~\nL = 1 = \\lim_{x \\rightarrow 0}\\frac{\\cos(x)}{1},\n~$$\n\nSo, as well, $\\lim_{x \\rightarrow 0} \\sin(x)/x = 1$.\n\nThis is due to $\\cos(x)$ being continuous at $0$, so this limit is\njust $\\cos(0)/1$. (More importantly, the tangent line expansion of\n$\\sin(x)$ at $0$ is $\\sin(0) + \\cos(0)x$, so that $\\cos(0)$ is why\nthis answer is as it is, but we don't need to think in terms of\n$\\cos(0)$, but rather the tangent-line expansion, which is $\\sin(x)\n\\approx x$, as $\\cos(0)$ appears as the coefficient.\n\n#####  Examples\n\n- Consider this limit at $0$: $(a^x - 1)/x$. We have $f(x) =a^x-1$ has\n  $f(0) = 0$, so this limit is indeterminate of the form $0/0$. The\n  derivative of $f(x)$ is $f'(x) = a^x \\log(a)$ which has $f'(0) = \\log(a)$.\n  The derivative of the bottom is also $1$ at $0$, so we have:\n\n$$~\n\\log(a) = \\frac{\\log(a)}{1} = \\frac{f'(0)}{g'(0)} = \\lim_{x \\rightarrow 0}\\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)} = \\lim_{x \\rightarrow 0}\\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\n= \\lim_{x \\rightarrow 0}\\frac{a^x - 1}{x}.\n~$$\n\n(Why rewrite in the \"opposite\" direction? Because the theorem's result ($L$ is the limit) is only true if the related limit involving the derivative exists.)\n\n- Consider this limit:\n\n$$~\n\\lim_{x \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{x}.\n~$$\n\nIt too is of the indeterminate form $0/0$. The derivative of the top\nis $e^x + e^{-x}$, which is $2$ when $x=0$, so the ratio of\n$f'(0)/g'(0)$ is seen to be 2. By L'Hospital's rule, the limit above is\n$2$.\n\n\n- Sometimes, L'Hospital's rule must be applied twice. Consider this\n  limit:\n\n$$~\n\\lim_{x \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{\\cos(x)}{1 - x^2}\n~$$\n\nBy L'Hospital's rule *if* this following limit exists, the two will be equal:\n\n$$~\n\\lim_{x \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{-\\sin(x)}{-2x}.\n~$$\n\nBut if we didn't guess the answer, we see that this new problem is *also* indeterminate\nof the form $0/0$. So, repeating the process, this new limit will exist and be equal to the following\nlimit, should it exist:\n\n$$~\n\\lim_{x \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{-\\cos(x)}{-2} = 1/2.\n~$$\n\nAs $L = 1/2$ for this related limit, it must also be the limit of the original problem, by L'Hospital's rule.\n\n\n- Our \"intuitive\" limits can bump into issues. Take for example the limit of $(\\sin(x)-x)/x^2$ as $x$ goes to $0$. Using $\\sin(x) \\approx x$ makes this look like $0/x^2$ which is still indeterminate. (Because the difference is higher order than $x$.) Using L'Hospitals, says this limit will exist (and be equal) if the following one does:\n\n$$~\n\\lim_{x \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{\\cos(x) - 1}{2x}.\n~$$\n\nThis particular limit is indeterminate of the form $0/0$, so we again try L'Hospital's rule and consider\n\n\n$$~\n\\lim_{x \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{-\\sin(x)}{2} = 0\n~$$\n\nSo as this limit exists, working backwards, the original limit in question will also be $0$.\n\n\n- This example comes from the Wikipedia page. It \"proves\" a discrete approximation for the second derivative.\n\nShow if $f''(x)$ exists at $c$ and is continuous at $c$, then\n\n$$~\nf''(c) = \\lim_{h \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{f(c + h) - 2f(c) + f(c-h)}{h^2}.\n~$$\n\nThis will follow from two applications of L'Hospital's rule to the\nright-hand side. The first says, the limit on the right is equal to\nthis limit, should it exist:\n\n$$~\n\\lim_{h \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{f'(c+h) - 0 - f'(c-h)}{2h}.\n~$$\n\nWe have to be careful, as we differentiate in the $h$ variable, not\nthe $c$ one, so the chain rule brings out the minus sign. But again,\nas we still have an indeterminate form $0/0$, this limit will equal the\nfollowing limit should it exist:\n\n$$~\n\\lim_{h \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{f''(c+h) - 0 - (-f''(c-h))}{2} =\n\\lim_{c \\rightarrow 0}\\frac{f''(c+h) + f''(c-h)}{2} = f''(c).\n~$$\n\nThat last equality follows, as it is assumed that $f''(x)$ exists at $c$ and is continuous, that is, $f''(c \\pm h) \\rightarrow f''(c)$.\n\nThe expression above finds use when second derivatives are numerically approximated. (The middle expression is the basis of the central-finite difference approximation to the derivative.)\n\n## Why?\n\nThe proof of L'Hospital's rule takes advantage of Cauchy's\n[generalization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_value_theorem#Cauchy.27s_mean_value_theorem)\nof the mean value theorem to two functions. Let $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ be\ncontinuous on $[a,b]$ and differentiable on $(a,b)$ so that on\n$[c,c+x]$ there exists a $\\xi$ with $f'(\\xi) \\cdot (f(x) - f(c)) =\ng'(\\xi) \\cdot (g(x) - g(c))$. In our formulation, both $f(c)$ and $g(c)$\nare zero, so we have, provided we know that $g(x)$ is non zero, that\n$f(x)/g(x) = f'(\\xi)/g'(\\xi)$ for some $\\xi$, $c < \\xi < c + x$. That\nthe right-hand side has a limit as $x \\rightarrow c+$ is true by the\nassumption that the limit of the derivative's ratio exists. (The $\\xi$\npart can be removed by considering it as a composition of a function\ngoing to $c$.) Thus the right limit of the left hand side is\nknown. Similarly, working with $[c-x, c]$ we can get the left limit is\nknown and is equal to the right.\n\n### L'Hospital's picture"

        "## Generalizations\n\nL'Hospital's rule generalizes to other indeterminate forms, in\nparticular $\\infty/\\infty$ can be proved at the same time as $0/0$\nwith a more careful\n[proof](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27H%C3%B4pital%27s_rule#General_proof).\n\n\nIn addition, indeterminate forms of the type $0 \\cdot \\infty$, $0^0$\nand $\\infty^\\infty$ can be re-expressed to be in the form $0/0$ or\n$\\infty/\\infty$.\n\n\nFor example, consider\n\n$$~\n\\lim_{x \\rightarrow \\infty} \\frac{x}{e^x}.\n~$$\n\nWe see it is of the form $\\infty/\\infty$ (That we are taking a limit\nat $\\infty$ is also a generalization.)
