An example might be $x^2 + y^2\n= 1$.\n\nThe **solutions** to an equation in the variables $x$ and $y$ are all\npoints $(x,y)$ which satisfy the equation.\n\nThe **graph** of an equation is just the set of solutions to the equation represented in the Cartesian plane.\n\nWith this definition, the graph of a function $f(x)$ is just the graph of the equation $y = f(x)$.\n\nIn general, graphing an equation is more complicated than graphing a\nfunction. For a function, we know for a given value of $x$ what\nthe corresponding value of $f(x)$ is through evaluation of the function. For\nequations, we may have 0, 1 or more $y$ values for a given $x$ and\neven more problematic is we may have no rule to find these values.\n\n\nTo plot such an equation in `Julia`, we can use the\n`ImplicitEquations` package, which is loaded when `CalculusWithJulia` is:"

        "## Tangent lines, implicit differentiation\n\n\nThe graph $x^2 + y^2 = 1$ has well-defined tangent lines at all points except\n$(-1,0)$ and $(0, 1)$ and even at these two points, we could call the vertical lines\n$x=-1$ and $x=1$ tangent lines. However, to recover the slope would\nneed us to express $y$ as a function of $x$ and then differentiate\nthat function. Of course, in this example, we would need two functions:\n$f(x) = \\sqrt{1-x^2}$ and $g(x) = - \\sqrt{1-x^2}$ to do this\ncompletely.\n\nIn general though, we may not be able to solve for $y$ in terms of $x$. What then?\n\nThe idea is to *assume* that $y$ is representable by some function of\n$x$. This makes sense, moving on the curve from $(x,y)$ to some nearby\npoint, means changing $x$ will cause some change in $y$. This\nassumption is only made *locally* - basically meaning a complicated\ngraph is reduced to just a small, well-behaved, section of its graph.\n\n\nWith this assumption, asking what $dy/dx$ is has an obvious meaning -\nwhat is the slope of the tangent line to the graph at $(x,y)$.\n\nThe method of implicit differentiation allows this question to be\ninvestigated. It begins by differentiating both sides of the equation\nassuming $y$ is a function of $x$ to derive a new equation involving $dy/dx$.\n\nFor example,  starting with $x^2 + y^2 = 1$, differentiating both sides in $x$ gives:\n\n$$~\n2x + 2y\\cdot \\frac{dy}{dx} = 0.\n~$$\n\nThe chain rule was used to find $d/dx(y^2) = 2y \\cdot dy/dx$. From this we can solve for $dy/dx$ (the resulting equations are linear in $dy/dx$, so can always be solved explicitly):\n\n$$~\ndy/dx = -x/y\n~$$\n\nThis says the slope of the tangent line depends on the point $(x,y)$ through the formula $-x/y$.\n\n\nAs a check, we compare to what we would have found had we solved for\n$y= \\sqrt{1 - x^2}$ (for $(x,y)$ with $y \\geq 0$). We would have\nfound: $dy/dx = 1/2 \\cdot 1/\\sqrt{1 - x^2} \\cdot -2x$. Which can be\nsimplified to $-x/y$. This should show that the method\nabove - assuming $y$ is a function of $x$ and differentiating - is not\nonly more general, but can even be easier.\n\nThe name - *implicit differentiation* - comes from the assumption that\n$y$ is implicitly defined in terms of $x$.  According to the\n[Implicit Function Theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_function_theorem) the\nabove method will work provided the curve has sufficient smoothness\nnear the point $(x,y)$.\n\n##### Examples\n\nConsider the [serpentine](http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/Curves/Serpentine.html) equation\n\n$$~\nx^2y + a\\cdot b \\cdot y - a^2 \\cdot x = 0, \\quad a\\cdot b > 0.\n~$$\n\nFor $a = 2, b=1$ we have the graph:"

        "## Inverse functions\n\nAs [mentioned](../precalc/inversefunctions.html), an [inverse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_function) function for $f(x)$ is a function $g(x)$ satisfying:\n$y = f(x)$ if and only if $g(y) = x$ for all $x$ in the domain of $f$ and $y$ in the range of $f$.\n\nIn short, both $f \\circ g$ and $g \\circ f$ are identify functions on their respective domains.\nAs inverses are unique, their notation, $f^{-1}(x)$, reflects the name of the related function.\nfunction.\n\nThe chain rule can be used to give the derivative of an inverse\nfunction when applied to $f(f^{-1}(x)) = x$. Solving gives,\n$[f^{-1}(x)]' = 1 / f'(g(x))$.\n\nThis is great - if we can remember the rules. If not, sometimes implicit\ndifferentiation can also help.\n\nConsider the inverse function for the tangent, which exists when the domain of the tangent function is restricted to $(-\\pi/2, \\pi/2)$. The function solves $y = \\tan^{-1}(x)$ or $\\tan(y) = x$. Differentiating this yields:\n\n$$~\n\\sec(y)^2 \\frac{dy}{dx} = 1.\n~$$\n\nBut $\\sec(y)^2 = 1 + x^2$, as can be seen by right-triangle trigonometry. This yields the formula $dy/dx = [\\tan^{-1}(x)]' = 1 / (1 + x^2)$.\n\n##### Example\n\nFor a more complicated example, suppose we have a moving trajectory $(x(t),\ny(t))$. The angle it makes with the origin satisfies\n\n$$~\n\\tan(\\theta(t)) = \\frac{y(t)}{x(t)}.\n~$$\n\nSuppose $\\theta(t)$ can be defined in terms of the inverse to some\nfunction ($\\tan^{-1}(x)$). We can differentiate implicitly to find $\\theta'(t)$ in\nterms of derivatives of $y$ and $x$:\n\n$$~\n\\sec^2(\\theta(t)) \\cdot \\theta'(t) = \\frac{y'(t) x(t) - y(t) x'(t)}{x(t))^2}.\n~$$\n\nBut $\\sec^2(\\theta(t)) = (r(t)/x(t))^2 = (x(t)^2 + y(t)^2) / x(t)^2$, so moving to the other side the secant term gives an explicit, albeit complicated, expression for the derivative of $\\theta$ in terms of the functions $x$ and $y$:\n\n$$~\n\\theta'(t) = \\frac{x^2}{x^2(t) + y^2(t)} \\cdot \\frac{y'(t) x(t) - y(t) x'(t)}{x(t))^2} = \\frac{y'(t) x(t) - y(t) x'(t)}{x^2(t) + y^2(t)}.\n~$$\n\nThis could have been made easier, had we leveraged the result of the previous example.\n\n## Example from physics\n\nMany problems are best done with implicit derivatives. A video showing\nsuch a problem along with how to do it analytically is\n[here](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-01sc-single-variable-calculus-fall-2010/unit-2-applications-of-differentiation/part-b-optimization-related-rates-and-newtons-method/session-32-ring-on-a-string/).\n\nThis video starts with a simple question:\n\n\n> If you have a rope and heavy ring, where will the ring position itself\n> due to gravity?\n\n\nWell, suppose you hold the rope in two places, which we can take to be\n$(0,0)$ and $(a,b)$. Then let $(x,y)$ be all the possible positions of\nthe ring that hold the rope taught. Then we have this picture:"
