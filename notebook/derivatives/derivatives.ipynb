        "Before defining the derivative of a function, let's begin with two\nmotivating examples.\n\n##### Example: Driving\n\nImagine motoring along down highway 61 leaving Minnesota on the way to\nNew Orleans; though lost in listening to music, still mindful of the\nspeedometer and odometer, both prominently placed on the dashboard of\nthe car.\n\nThe speedometer reads 60 miles per hour, what is the odometer doing?\nBesides recording total distance traveled, it is incrementing\ndutifully every hour by 60 miles. Why? Well, the well-known formula relating distance, time and rate of travel is\n\n$$~\n\\text{distance} = \\text{ rate } \\times \\text{ time.}\n~$$\n\nIf the rate is a constant $60$ miles/hour, then in one hour the distance traveled is 60 miles.\n\nOf course, the odometer isn't just incrementing once per hour, it is incrementing once every 1/10th of a mile. How much time does that take? Well, we would need to solve $1/10=60 \\cdot t$ which means $t=1/600$ hours, better known as once every 6 seconds.\n\nUsing some mathematical notation, would give $x(t) = v\\cdot t$, where\n$x$ is position at time $t$, $v$ is the velocity and $t$ the time\ntraveled in hours. A simple graph of the first three hours of travel would show:"

As Galileo had no ultra-accurate measuring device,\nhe needed to slow movement down by controlling the angle of the\nramp. With this, he could measure units of distance per units of time.\n(Click through to *Galileo and Perspective* [Dauben](http://www.mcm.edu/academic/galileo/ars/arshtml/mathofmotion1.html).)\n\n\nSuppose that no matter what the incline was, Galileo observed that in\nunits of the distance traveled in the first second that the distance\ntraveled between subsequent seconds was $3$ times, then $5$ times, then\n$7$ times, ...

        "## Rules of derivatives\n\nWe could proceed in a similar manner to find other derivatives, but\nlet's not. If we have a function $f(x) = x^5 \\sin(x)$, it would be\nnice to leverage our previous work on the derivatives of $f(x) =x^5$\nand $g(x) = \\sin(x)$, rather than derive an answer from scratch.\n\n\nAs with limits and continuity, it proves very useful to consider rules\nthat make the process of finding derivatives of combinations of\nfunctions a matter of combining derivatives of the individual functions in some manner.\n\n### Sum rule\n\nLet's consider $k(x) = a\\cdot f(x) + b\\cdot g(x)$, what is its derivative? That is, in terms of $f$, $g$ and their derivatives, can we express $k'(x)$?\n\nWe can rearrange $(k(x+h) - k(x))$ as follows:\n\n$$~\n(a\\cdot f(x+h) + b\\cdot g(x+h)) - (a\\cdot f(x) + b \\cdot g(x)) =\na\\cdot (f(x+h) - f(x)) + b \\cdot (g(x+h) - g(x)).\n~$$\n\nDividing by $h$, we see that this becomes\n\n$$~\na\\cdot \\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h} + b \\cdot \\frac{g(x+h) - g(x)}{h} \\rightarrow a\\cdot f'(x) + b\\cdot g'(x).\n~$$\n\n\n\nThis holds two rules: the derivative of a constant times a function is\nthe constant times the derivative of the function; and the derivative\nof a sum of functions is the sum of the derivative of the functions.\n\n### Product rule\n\nOther rules can be similarly derived. `SymPy` can give us them as\nwell. Here we define to symbolic functions `u` and `v` and let `SymPy`\nderive a formula for the derivative of a product of functions:"

A common shorthand is $[uv]' = u'v +\nuv'$.\n\n\n\n### Quotient rule\n\nThe derivative of $f(x) = u(x)/v(x)$ - a ratio of functions - can be\nsimilarly computed. The result will be $[u/v]' = (u'v - uv')/u^2$.\n\n### Chain rule\n\nFinally, the derivative of a composition of functions can be\ncomputed. This gives a rule called the *chain rule*. Before deriving,\nlet's give a slight motivation.\n\n\nConsider the output of a factory for some widget. It depends on two steps:\nan initial manufacturing step and a finishing step. The number of\nemployees is important in how much is initially manufactured. Suppose\n$x$ is the number of employees and $g(x)$ is the amount initially\nmanufactured. Adding more employees increases the amount made by the\nmade-up rule $g(x) = \\sqrt{x}$. The finishing step depends on how much\nis made by the employees. If $y$ is the amount made, then $f(y)$ is\nthe number of widgets finished. Suppose for some reason that $f(y) =\ny^2.$\n\nHow many widgets are made as a function of employees? The composition\n$u(x) = f(g(x))$ would provide that.\n\nWhat is the effect of adding employees on the rate of output of widgets?\nIn this specific case we know the answer, as $(f \\circ g)(x) = x$, so\nthe answer is just the rate is $1$.\n\nIn general, we want to express $\\Delta f / \\Delta x$ in a form so that we can take a limit.\n\nBut what do we know? We know $\\Delta g / \\Delta x$ and $\\Delta f/\\Delta y$. Using $y=g(x)$, this suggests that we might have luck with the right side of this equation:\n\n$$~\n\\frac{\\Delta f}{\\Delta x} = \\frac{\\Delta f}{\\Delta y} \\cdot \\frac{\\Delta y}{\\Delta x}.\n~$$\n\n\nInterpreting this, we get the *average* rate of change in the\ncomposition can be thought of as a product: The *average* rate of\nchange of the initial step ($\\Delta y/ \\Delta x$) times the *average*\nrate of the change of the second step evaluated not at $x$, but at\n$y$, $\\Delta f/ \\Delta y$.\n\n\nRe-expressing using derivative notation with $h$ would be:\n\n\n$$~\n\\frac{f(g(x+h)) - f(g(x))}{h} = \\frac{f(g(x+h)) - f(g(x))}{g(x+h) - g(x)} \\cdot \\frac{g(x+h) - g(x)}{h}.\n~$$\n\nThe left hand side will converge to the derivative of $u(x)$ or $[f(g(x))]'$.\n\nThe right most part of the right side would have a limit $g'(x)$, were\nwe to let $h$ go to $0$.\n\nIt isn't obvious, but the left part of the right side has the limit\n$f'(g(x))$. This would be clear if *only* $g(x+h) = g(x) + h$, for\nthen the expression would be exactly the limit expression with\n$c=g(x)$. But, alas, except to some hopeful students and some special\ncases, it is definitely not the case in general that $g(x+h) = g(x) + h$ - that\nright parentheses actually means something. However, it is *nearly*\nthe case that $g(x+h) = g(x) + kh$ for some $k$ and this can be used to formulate a\nproof (one of the two detailed\n[here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_rule#Proofs) and [here](http://kruel.co/math/chainrule.pdf)).\n\nWe can verify this using `SymPy`:"

        "Combined, we would end up with:\n\n\n> The chain rule: $[f(g(x))]' = f'(g(x)) \\cdot g'(x)$. That is the\n> derivative of the outer function evaluated at the inner function\n> times the derivative of the inner function.\n\n\nTo see that this works in our specific case, we assume the general\npower rule that $[x^n]' = n x^{n-1}$ to get: $g'(x) = (1/2)x^{-1/2}$,\n$f'(x)=2x$, and $f'(g(x)) = 2(\\sqrt{x})$. Together, the product is:\n\n$$~\n2\\sqrt{x} \\cdot (1/2) 1/\\sqrt{x} = 1\n~$$\n\nWhich is the same as the derivative of $x$ found by first evaluating the composition.\n\n##### Proof of the Chain Rule\n\nA function is *differentiable* at $a$ if the following limit exists $\\lim_{h \\rightarrow 0}(f(a+h)-f(a))/h$. Reexpressing this as: $f(a+h) - f(a) - f'(a)h = \\epsilon_f(h) h$ where as $h\\rightarrow 0$, $\\epsilon_f(h) \\rightarrow 0$. Then, we have:\n\n$$~\ng(a+h) = g(a) + g'(a)h + \\epsilon_g(h) h = g(a) + h',\n~$$\n\nWhere $h' = (g'(a) + \\epsilon_g(h))h \\rightarrow 0$ as $h \\rightarrow 0$ will be used to simplify the following:\n\n\n\n$$~\n\\begin{align}\nf(g(a+h)) - f(g(a)) &=\nf(g(a) + g'(a)h + \\epsilon_g(h)h) - f(g(a)) \\\\\n&= f(g(a)) + f'(g(a)) (g'(a)h + \\epsilon_g(h)h) + \\epsilon_f(h')(h') - f(g(a))\\\\\n&= f'(g(a)) g'(a)h  + f'(g(a))(\\epsilon_g(h)h) + \\epsilon_f(h')(h').\n\\end{align}\n~$$\n\nRearranging:\n\n$$~\nf(g(a+h)) - f(g(a)) - f'(g(a)) g'(a) h = f'(g(a))\\epsilon_g(h))h + \\epsilon_f(h')(h') =\n(f'(g(a)) \\epsilon_g(h)  + \\epsilon_f(h')( (g'(a) + \\epsilon_g(h))))h =\n\\epsilon(h)h,\n~$$\n\nwhere $\\epsilon(h)$ combines the above terms which go to zero as $h\\rightarrow 0$ into one. This is\nthe alternative definition of the derivative, showing $(f\\circ g)'(a) = f'(g(a)) g'(a)$ when $g$ is differentiable at $a$ and $f$ is differentiable at $g(a)$.\n\n\n##### More examples\n\n- Find the derivative of $x^5 \\cdot \\sin(x)$.\n\nThis is a product of functions, using $[u\\cdot v]' = u'v + uv'$ we get:\n\n$$~\n5x^4 \\cdot \\sin(x) + x^5 \\cdot \\cos(x)\n~$$\n\n- Find the derivative of $x^5 / \\sin(x)$.\n\nThis is a quotient of functions. Using $[u/v]' = (u'v - uv')/v^2$ we get\n\n$$~\n(5x^4 \\cdot \\sin(x) - x^5 \\cdot \\cos(x)) / (\\sin(x))^2.\n~$$\n\n- Find the derivative of $\\sin(x^5)$. This is a composition of\n  functions $u(v(x))$ with $v(x) = x^5$. The chain rule says find the\n  derivative of $u$ ($\\cos(x)$) and evaluate at $v(x)$ ($\\cos(x^5)$)\n  then multiply by the derivative of $v$:\n\n$$~\n\\cos(x^5) \\cdot 5x^4.\n~$$\n\n- Similarly, but differently, find the derivative of $\\sin(x)^5$. Now\n  $v(x) = \\sin(x)$, so the derivative of $u(x)$ ($5x^4$) evaluated at\n  $v(x)$ is $5(\\sin(x))^4$ so multiplying by $v'$ gives:\n\n$$~\n5(\\sin(x))^4 \\cdot \\cos(x)\n~$$\n\n\nWe can verify these with `SymPy`. Rather than take a limit, we will\nuse `SymPy`'s `diff` function to compute derivatives."
