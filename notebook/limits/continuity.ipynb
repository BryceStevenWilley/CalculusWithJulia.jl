        "Though similar at some level - they agree at nearly every value of\n$x$ - the first has a \"jump\" from $-1$ to $1$ instead of the\ntransition in the second one. The first is not continuous at $0$ - a\nbreak is needed to draw it - where as the second is continuous.\n\n\n\nA formal definition was a bit harder to come to. At\n[first](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_value_theorem) the\nconcept that for any $y$ between any two values in the range for\n$f(x)$, the function should take the value $y$ was included. Clearly\nthis could distinguish the two graphs above, as one takes no values in\n$(-1,1)$, whereas the other - the continuous one - takes on all values in that range.\n\n\nHowever, [Cauchy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cours_d%27Analyse)\ndefined continuity by $f(x + \\alpha) - f(x)$ being small whenever\n$\\alpha$ was small. This basically rules out \"jumps\" and proves more\nuseful as a tool to describe continuity.\n\n\nThe [modern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function#History)\ndefinition simply pushes the details to the definition of the limit:\n\n> A function $f(x)$ is continuous at $x=c$ if $\\lim_{x \\rightarrow c}f(x) = f(c)$.\n\nThis says three things\n\n* The limit exists at $c$.\n\n* The function is defined at $c$ ($c$ is in the domain).\n\n* The value of the limit is the same as $f(c)$.\n\n\nThis speaks to continuity at a point, we can extend this to continuity over an interval $(a,b)$ by saying:\n\n> A function $f(x)$ is continuous over $(a,b)$ if at each point $c$ with $a < c < b$, $f(x)$ is continuous at $c$.\n\nFinally, as with limits, it can be convenient to speak of *right*\ncontinuity and *left* continuity at a point, where the limit in the\ndefintion is replaced by a right or left limit, as appropriate."

        "##### Examples of continuity\n\nMost familiar functions are continuous everywhere.\n\n* For example, a monomial function $f(x) = ax^n$ for non-negative, integer $n$ will be continuous. This is because the limit exists everywhere, the domain of $f$ is all $x$ and there are no jumps.\n\n* Similarly, the basic trigonometric functions $\\sin(x)$, $\\cos(x)$ are continuous everywhere.\n\n* So are the exponential functions $f(x) = a^x, a > 0$.\n\n* The hyperbolic sine ($(e^x - e^{-x})/2$) and cosine ($(e^x + e^{-x})/2$) are, as $e^x$ is.\n\n* The hyperbolic tangent is, as $\\cosh(x) > 0$ for all $x$.\n\nSome familiar functions are continuous but not everywhere.\n\n* For example, $f(x) = \\sqrt{x}$ is continuous on $(0,\\infty)$ and right continuous at $0$, but it is not defined for negative $x$, so can't possibly be continuous there.\n\n* Similarly, $f(x) = \\log(x)$ is continuous on $(0,\\infty)$, but it is not defined at $x=0$, so is not right continuous at $0$.\n\n* The tangent function $\\tan(x) = \\sin(x)/\\cos(x)$ is continuous everywhere *except* the points $x$ with $\\cos(x) = 0$ ($\\pi/2 + k\\pi, k$ an integer).\n\n* The hyperbolic co-tangent is not continuous at $x=0$ when $\\sinh$ is $0$,\n\n* The semicircle $f(x) = \\sqrt{1 - x^2}$ is *continuous* on $(-1, 1)$. It is not continous at $-1$ and $1$, though it is right continuous at $-1$ and left continous at $1$.\n\n##### Examples of discontinuity\n\nThere are various reasons why a function may not be continuous.\n\n* The function $f(x) = \\sin(x)/x$ has a limit at $0$ but is not defined at $0$, so is not continuous at $0$. The function can be redefined to make it continuous.\n\n* The function $f(x) = 1/x$ is continuous everywhere *except* $x=0$.\n\n* A rational function $f(x) = p(x)/q(x)$ will be continuous everywhere except where $q(x)=0$.\n\n* The function\n\n$$~\nf(x) = \\begin{cases}\n         -1 & x < 0 \\\\\n          0 & x = 0 \\\\\n          1 & x > 0\n\\end{cases}\n~$$\n\nis implemented by `Julia`'s `sign` function. It has a value at $0$,\nbut no limit at $0$, so is not continuous at $0$. Furthermore, the\nleft and right limits exist at $0$ but are not equal to $f(0)$ so the\nfunction is not left or right continuous at $0$. It is continous everywhere except at $x=0$.\n\n* Similarly, the function defined by this graph"

How do these relate with continuity?\n\nSuppose $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are both continuous on $(a,b)$. Then\n\n* The function $h(x) = \\alpha f(x) + \\beta g(x)$ is continuous on $(a,b)$ for any real numbers $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$;\n\n* The function $h(x) = f(x) \\cdot g(x)$ is continuous on $(a,b)$; and\n\n* The function $h(x) = f(x) / g(x)$ is continuous at all points $c$ in $(a,b)$ **where** $g(c) \\neq 0$.\n\n* The function $h(x) = f(g(x))$ is continuous at $x=c$ *if*  $g(x)$ is continuous at $c$ *and* $f(x)$ is continous at $g(c)$.\n\nSo, continuity is preserved for all of the basic operations except when dividing by $0$.\n\n##### Examples\n\n* Since a monomial $f(x) = ax^n$ ($n$ a non-negative integer) is continuous, by the first rule, any polynomial will be continuous.\n\n* Since both $f(x) = e^x$ and $g(x)=\\sin(x)$ are continuous everywhere, so will be $h(x) = e^x \\cdot \\sin(x)$.\n\n* Since $f(x) = e^x$ is continuous everywhere and $g(x) = -x$ is continuous everywhere, the composition $h(x) = e^{-x}$ will be continuous everywhere.\n\n* Since $f(x) = x$ is continuous everywhere, the function $h(x) = 1/x$ - a ratio of continuous functions - will be continuous everywhere *except* possibly at $x=0$ (where it is not continuous).\n\n* The function $h(x) = e^{x\\log(x)}$ will be continuous on $(0,\\infty)$, the same domain that $g(x) = x\\log(x)$ is continuous. This function (also written as $x^x$) has a right limit at $0$ (of $1$), but is not right continuous, as $h(0)$ is not defined.\n\n\n## Questions\n\n###### Question\n\nLet $f(x) = \\sin(x)$ and $g(x) = \\cos(x)$.
