        "The figure illustrates a means to compute the area bounded by the\nparabola, the line $y=1$ and the line $x=0$ using triangles. It\nsuggests that this area can be found by adding the following sum\n\n$$~\nA = 1/2 + 1/8 + 2 \\cdot (1/8)^2 + 4 \\cdot (1/8)^3 + \\cdots\n~$$\n\nThis value is $2/3$, so the area under the curve would be\n$1/3$. Forget about this specific value - which through more modern machinery becomes uneventful - and focus for a minute on the\nmethod: a problem is solved by a suggestion of an infinite process, in\nthis case the creation of more triangles to approximate the\nunaccounted for area. This is the so-call method of\n[exhaustion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_exhaustion) known\nsince the 5th century BC. Archimedes used this method to solve a wide\nrange of area problems related to basic geometric shapes, including a\nmore general statement of what we described above.\n\nThe $\\cdots$ in the sum expression are the indication that this process continues and that\nthe answer is at the end of an *infinite* process. To make this line of\nreasoning rigorous requires the concept of a limit. The concept of a\nlimit is then an old one, but it wasn't until the age of calculus\nthat it was formalized.\n\n[Fermat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adequality) in the 1600s\nessentially took a limit to find the slope of a tangent line to a\npolynomial curve. Newton in the late 1600s, exploited the idea in his\ndevelopment of calculus (as did Leibniz). Yet it wasn't until the\n1800s that\n[Bolzano](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_of_a_function#History),\nCauchy and Weierstrass put the idea on a firm footing.\n\n\nTo make things more precise, we begin by discussing the limit of a univariate function as $x$ approaches $c$.\n\nInformally, if a limit exists it is the value that $f(x)$ gets close to as $x$ gets close to - but not equal to - $c$.\n\nThe modern formulation is due to Weirstrass:\n\n> The limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $c$ is $L$ if for every real $\\epsilon > 0$,\n> there exists a real $\\delta > 0$ such that for all real $x$, $0 < \\lvert x − c \\rvert < \\delta$\n> implies $\\lvert f(x) − L \\rvert < \\epsilon$. The notation used is $\\lim_{x \\rightarrow c}f(x) = L$.\n\nWe comment on this later.\n\n\nCauchy begins his incredibly influential\n[treatise](http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k90196z/f25.image) on\ncalculus considering two examples, the limit as $x$ goes to $0$ of\n\n$$~ \\frac{\\sin(x)}{x} \\quad\\text{and}\\quad (1 + x)^{1/x}.  ~$$\n\nThese take the indeterminate forms $0/0$ and $1^\\infty$, which are\nfound by just putting $0$ in for $x$. An expression does not need to\nbe defined at $c$, as these two aren't, to discuss its limit. Cauchy\nillustrates two methods to approach the questions above. The first is\nto pull out an inequality:\n\n$$~\n\\frac{\\sin(x)}{\\sin(x)} > \\frac{\\sin(x)}{x} > \\frac{\\sin(x)}{\\tan(x)}.\n~$$\n\nThis bounds the expression $\\sin(x)/x$ between $1$ and $\\cos(x)$ and as $x$ gets close to $0$, the value of $\\cos(x)$ \"clearly\" goes to $1$, hence $L$ must be $1$. This is an application of the squeeze theorem.\n\nTo discuss the case of $(1+x)^{1/x}$, Cauchy first resorts to log tables\nto illustrate an approximate value. We can use `Julia` to find his\napproximate value:"

Cauchy\ndemonstrates this value with a fair amount of work.\n\nThese two cases illustrate that though the definition of the limit\nexists, the computation of a limit is generally found by other means\nand the intuition of the value of the limit can be gained numerically.\n\n### Indeterminate forms\n\nFirst it should be noted that for most of the functions encountered, the concepts of a limit at a typical point $c$ is nothing more than just function evaluation at $c$. This is because, at a typical point, the functions are nicely behaved. However, most questions asked about limits find points that are not typical. For these, the result of evaluating the function at $c$ is typically undefined, and the value comes in one of several *indeterminate forms*: $0/0$, $\\infty/\\infty$, $0 \\cdot \\infty$, $\\infty - \\infty$, $0^0$, $1^\\infty$, and $\\infty^0$.\n\n`Julia` can help - at times - identify these indeterminate forms, as many such operations produce `NaN`.

        "These, together with the fact that our basic algebraic functions have limits\nthat can be found by simple evaluation, mean that many limits are easy to\ncompute.\n\n##### Example, composition\n\nFor example, consider for some non-zero $k$ the following limit:\n\n$$~\n\\lim_{x \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{\\sin(kx)}{x}.\n~$$\n\nThis is clearly related to the function $f(x) = \\sin(x)/x$, but is in fact the limit of the function $g(x) = k f(kx)$. This then follows:\n\n\n$$~\n\\lim_{x \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{\\sin(kx)}{x} = \\lim_{x \\rightarrow 0} k f(kx) = k \\lim_{x \\rightarrow 0} f(kx) = k\\lim_{x \\rightarrow 0} f(x) = k.\n~$$\n\nWhy does the limit of $f(kx)$ at 0 equal the limit of $f(x)$ at 0?\nWell, $f(kx)$ is a composition, $f(h(x))$ where $h(x) = kx$. The limit\nof $h$ at 0 is 0, so this is a special case of the rule for\ncompositions.\n\nBasically when taking a limit as $x$ goes to $0$ we can multiply $x$ by any constant and figure out the limit for that. (It is as though we \"go to\" $0$ faster or slower. but are still going to $0$. This can be generalized to any function $g(x)$ with a limit of $0$ at $0$: $\\lim_{x \\rightarrow 0}f(g(x)) = \\lim_{x \\rightarrow 0}f(x)$.)\n\n##### Example, products\n\nConsider this complicated limit found on this [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27H%C3%B4pital%27s_rule) page.\n\n$$~\n\\lim_{x \\rightarrow 1/2} \\frac{\\sin(\\pi x)}{\\pi x} \\cdot \\frac{\\cos(\\pi x)}{1 - (2x)^2}.\n~$$\n\nWe know the first factor has a limit found by evaluation: $2/\\pi$, so it is really just a constant.
