Similarly to our example of $\\sin(1/x)$, near\n$0$ the function get's close to both $1$ and $-1$, so will have no\nlimit. (Again, just take $\\epsilon$ smaller than $1$.)\n\nBut unlike the previous example, this function *would* have a limit if\nthe definition didn't consider values of $x$ on both sides of $c$.

That is, $U$ is $(c, c+\\delta)$\n\nSimilarly, a limit on the left is defined where $U=(c-\\delta, c)$.\n\nThe `SymPy` function `limit` has a keyword argument `dir=\"+\"` or\n`dir=\"-\"` to request that a one-sided limit be formed."
