        "In the early years of calculus, the intermediate value theorem was\nintricately connected with the definition of continuity, now it is a\nconsequence.\n\nThe basic proof starts with a set of points in $[a,b]$: $C = \\{x\n\\text{ in } [a,b] \\text{ with } f(x) \\leq y\\}$. The set is not empty\n(as $a$ is in $C$) so it *must* have a largest value, call it $c$\n(this requires the completeness property of the real numbers).  By\ncontinuity of $f$, it can be shown that $\\lim_{x \\rightarrow c-} f(x)\n= f(c) \\leq y$ and $\\lim_{y \\rightarrow c+}f(x) =f(c) \\geq y$, which\nforces $f(c) = y$.\n\n\n### Bolzano and the bisection method\n\nSuppose we have a continuous function $f(x)$ on $[a,b]$ with $f(a) <\n0$ and $f(b) > 0$. Then as $f(a) < 0 < f(b)$, the intermediate value\ntheorem guarantees the existence of a $c$ in $[a,b]$ with $f(c) =\n0$. This was a special case of the intermediate value theorem proved\nby Bolzano first. Such $c$ are called *zeros* of the function $f$.\n\nWe use this fact when a building a \"sign chart\" of a continous function.\nBetween any two consecutive zeros the function can not\nchange sign. (Why?) So a \"test point\" can be used to determine the\nsign of the function over an entire interval.\n\n\nHere, we use the Bolzano theorem to give an algorithm - the *bisection method* - to locate the value $c$ under the assumption $f$ is continous on $[a,b]$ and changes sign between $a$ and $b$."

There are functions which are continuous on open intervals\nfor which this result is not true. For example, $f(x) = 1/x$ on $(0,1)$. This\nfunction will have no smallest value or largest value, as defined above.\n\nThe extreme value theorem is an important theoretical tool for\ninvestigating maxima and minima of functions.\n\n\n##### Example\n\nThe function $f(x) = \\sqrt{1-x^2}$ is continuous on the interval\n$[-1,1]$ (in the sense above). It then has an absolute maximum, we can\nsee to be $1$ occurring at an interior point $0$. The absolute minimum\nis $0$, it occurs at each endpoint.\n\n##### Example\n\nThe function $f(x) = x \\cdot e^{-x}$ on the closed interval $[0, 5]$ is continuous.
