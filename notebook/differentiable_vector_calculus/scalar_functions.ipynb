        "Consider a function $f: R^n \\rightarrow R$. It has multiple arguments for its input (an $x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n$) and only one, *scalar*, value for an output. Some simple examples might be:\n\n$$~\n\\begin{align}\nf(x,y) &= x^2 + y^2\\\\\ng(x,y) &= x \\cdot y\\\\\nh(x,y) &= \\sin(x) \\cdot \\sin(y)\n\\end{align}\n~$$\n\n\nFor two examples from real life consider the elevation Point Query Service (of the [USGS](https://nationalmap.gov/epqs/)) returns the elevation in international feet or meters for a specific latitude/longitude within the United States. The longitude can be associated to an $x$ coordinate, the latitude to a $y$ coordinate, and the elevation a $z$ coordinate, and as long as the region is small enough, the $x$-$y$ coordinates can be thought to lie on a plane. (A flat earth assumption.)\n\nSimilarly,  a weather map, say of the United States, may show the maximum predicted temperature for a given day. This describes a function that take a position ($x$, $y$) and returns a predicted temperature ($z$).\n\n\n\nMathematically, we may describe the values $(x,y)$ in terms of a point, $P=(x,y)$ or a vector $\\vec{v} = \\langle x, y \\rangle$ using the identification of a point with a vector. As convenient, we may write any of $f(x,y)$, $f(P)$, or $f(\\vec{v})$ to describe the evaluation of $f$ at the value $x$ and $y$\n\n\nBefore proceeding with how to define such functions in `Julia`, we load our package:"

        "----\n\nFollowing a calculus perspective, we take up the question of how to\nvisualize scalar functions within `Julia`? Further, how to describe\nthe change in the function between nearby values?\n\n## Visualizing scalar functions\n\nSuppose for the moment that $f:R^2 \\rightarrow R$. The equation $z = f(x,y)$ may be visualized by the set of points in 3-dimensions $\\{(x,y,z): z = f(x,y)\\}$. This will render as a surface, and that surface will pass a \"vertical line test\", in that each $(x,y)$ value corresponds to at most one $z$ value.\nWe will see alternatives for describing surfaces beyond through a function of the form $z=f(x,y)$. These are similar to how a curve in the $x$-$y$ plane can be described by a function of the form $y=f(x)$ but also through an equation of the form $F(x,y) = c$ or through a parametric description, such as is used for planar curves. For now though we focus on the case where $z=f(x,y)$.\n\n\n\nIn `Julia`, plotting such a surface requires a generalization to plotting a univariate function where, typically, a grid of evenly spaced values is given between some $a$ and $b$, the corresponding $y$ or $f(x)$ values are found, and then the points are connected in a dot-to-dot manner.\n\nHere, a two-dimensional grid of $x$-$y$ values needs specifying, and the corresponding $z$ values found. As the grid will be assumed to be regular only the $x$ and $y$ values need specifying, the set of pairs can be computed. The $z$ values, it will be seen, are easily computed. This cloud of points is plotted and each cell in the $x$-$y$ plane is plotted with a surface giving the $x$-$y$-$z$, 3-dimensional, view. One way to plot such a surface is to tessalate the cell and then for each triangle, represent a plane made up of the 3 boundary points.\n\n\nHere is an example:"

        "This function has a prominent peak and a prominent valley, around the middle of the viewing window. The nested contour lines indicate this, and the color key can be used to identify which is the peak and which the valley.\n\n## Limits\n\nThe notion of a limit for a univariate function: as $x$ gets close to $c$ then $f(x)$ gets close to $L$, needs some modification:\n\n> Let $f: R^n \\rightarrow R$ and $C$ be a point in $R^n$. Then $\\lim_{P \\rightarrow C}f(P) = L$ if for every $\\epsilon > 0$ there exists a $\\delta > 0$ such that $|f(P) - L| < \\epsilon$ whenever $0 < \\| P - C \\| < \\delta$.\n\n(If $P=(x1, x2, \\dots, x_n)$ we use $f(P) = f(x1, x2, \\dots, x_n)$.)\n\nThis says, informally, for any scale about $L$ there is a \"ball\" about $C$ for which the images of $f$ always sit in the ball.\nFormally we define a ball of radius $r$ about a point $C$ to be all points $P$ with distance between $P$ and $C$ less than $r$. A ball is an *open* set. An [open](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_set#Euclidean_space) is a set $U$ such that for any $x$ in $U$, there is a radius $r$ such that the ball of radius $r$ about $x$ is *still* within $U$. An open set generalizes an open interval. A *closed* set generalizes a *closed* interval. These are [defined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_set) by a set that contains its boundary. Boundary points are any points that can be approached in the limit by points within the set.\n\n\n\n\nIn the univariate case, it can be useful to characterize a limit at $x=c$ existing if *both* the left and right limits exist and the two are equal. Generalizing to getting close in $R^m$ leads to\nthe intuitive idea of a limit existing in terms of any continuous \"path\" that approaches $C$ in the $x$-$y$ plane has a limit and all are equal. Let $\\gamma$ describe the path, and $\\lim_{s \\rightarrow t}\\gamma(s) = C$. Then $f \\circ \\gamma$ will be a univariate function. If there is a limit, $L$, then this composition will also have the same limit as $s \\rightarrow t$. Conversely, if for *every* path this composition has the *same* limit, then $f$ will have a limit.\n\nThe \"two path corollary\" is a trick to show a limit does not exist - just find two paths where there is a limit, but they differ, then a limit does not exist in general.\n\n### Continuity of scalar functions\n\nContinuity is defined in a familiar manner: $f(P)$ is continuous at $C$ if $\\lim_{P \\rightarrow C} f(P) = f(C)$, where we interpret $P \\rightarrow C$ in the sense of a ball about $C$.\n\nAs with univariate functions continuity will be preserved under function addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division (provided there is no dividing by $0$). With this, all these functions are continuous everywhere and so have limits everywhere:\n\n$$~\nf(x,y) = \\sin(x + y), \\quad\ng(x,y,z) = x^2 + y^2 + z^2, \\quad\nh(w, x,y,z) = \\sqrt{w^2 + x^2 + y^2 + z^2}.\n~$$\n\n\n\nNot all functions will have a limit though. Consider $f(x,y) = 2x^2/(x^2+y^2)$ and $C=(0,0)$. It is not defined at $C$, but may have a limit. Consider the path $x=0$ (the $y$ axis) parameterized by $\\vec\\gamma(t) = \\langle 0, t\\rangle$. Along this path $f\\circ \\vec\\gamma(t) = 0/t^2 = 0$ so will have a limit of $0$. If the limit of $f$ exists it must be $0$. But, along  the line $y=0$ (the $x$ axis) parameterized by $\\vec{\\gamma}(t) = \\langle t, 0 \\rangle$, the function simplifies to $f\\circ\\vec\\gamma(t)=2$, so would have a limit of $2$. As the limit along different paths is different, this function has no limit in general.\n\n\n##### Example\n\nIf is not enough that a limit exist along many paths to say a limit exists in general. It must be all paths and be equal. An example might be this function:\n\n$$~\nf(x,y) =\n\\begin{cases}\n(x + y)/(x-y) & x \\neq y,\\\\\n0 & x = y\n\\end{cases}\n~$$\n\nAt $\\vec{0}$ this will not have a limit. However, along any line $y=mx$ we have a limit. If $m=1$ the function is constantly $0$, and so has the limit. If $m \\neq 1$, then we get $f(x, y) = f(x, mx) = (1 + m)/(1-m)$, a constant So for each $m$ there is a different limit. Consequently, the scalar function does not have a limit.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Partial derivatives and the gradient\n\nDiscussing the behaviour of a scalar function along a path is described mathematically through composition. If $\\vec\\gamma(t)$ is a path in $R^n$, then the composition $f \\circ \\vec\\gamma$ will be a univariate function. When $n=2$, we can visualize this composition directly, or as a 3D path on the surface given by $\\vec{r}(t) = \\langle \\gamma_1(t), \\gamma_2(t), \\dots, \\gamma_n(t), (f \\circ \\vec\\gamma)(t) \\rangle$."

        "With this graph, we might be led to ask about derivatives or rates of change. For this example, we can algebraically compute the composition:\n\n$$~\n(f \\circ \\vec\\gamma)(t) = 2 - (2t) - 3(-2t^2)^2 = 2 - 2t +12t^4\n~$$\n\nFrom here we clearly have $f'(t) = -2 + 48t^3$. But could this be computed in terms of a \"derivative\" of $f$ and the derivative of $\\vec\\gamma$?\n\nBefore answering this, we discuss *directional* derivatives along the simplified paths $\\vec\\gamma_x(t) = \\langle t, c\\rangle$ or $\\vec\\gamma_y(t) = \\langle c, t\\rangle$.\n\nIf we compose $f \\circ \\vec\\gamma_x$, we can visualize this as a curve on the surface from $f$ that moves in the $x$-$y$ plane along the line $y=c$. The derivative of this curve will satisfy:\n\n$$~\n\\begin{align}\n(f \\circ \\vec\\gamma_x)'(x) &=\n\\lim_{t \\rightarrow x} \\frac{(f\\circ\\vec\\gamma_x)(t) - (f\\circ\\vec\\gamma_x)(x)}{t-x}\\\\\n&= \\lim_{t\\rightarrow x} \\frac{f(t, c) - f(x,c)}{t-x}\\\\\n&= \\lim_{h \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{f(x+h, c) - f(x, c)}{h}.\n\\end{align}\n~$$\n\nThe latter expresses this to be the derivative of the function that holds the $y$ value fixed, but lets the $x$ value vary. It is the rate of change in the $x$ direction. There is special notation for this:\n\n$$~\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{\\partial f(x,y)}{\\partial x} &=\n\\lim_{h \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{f(x+h, y) - f(x, y)}{h},\\quad\\text{and analogously}\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial f(x,y)}{\\partial y} &=\n\\lim_{h \\rightarrow 0} \\frac{f(x, y+h) - f(x, y)}{h}.\n\\end{align}\n~$$\n\nThese are called the *partial* derivatives of $f$. The symbol $\\partial$, read as \"partial\", is reminiscent of \"$d$\", but indicates the derivative is only in a given direction. Other notations exist for this:\n\n$$~\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}, \\quad f_x, \\quad \\partial_x f,\n~$$\n\nand more generally, when $n$ may be 2 or more,\n\n$$~\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_i}, \\quad f_{x_i}, \\quad f_i, \\quad \\partial_{x_i} f, \\quad \\partial_i f.\n~$$\n\n\nThe *gradient* of a scalar function $f$ is the vector comprised of the partial derivatives:\n\n$$~\n\\nabla f(x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n) = \\langle\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_1},\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_2}, \\dots,\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x_n} \\rangle.\n~$$\n\nAs seen, the gradient is a vector-valued function, but has, also, multivariable inputs. It is a function from $R^n \\rightarrow R^n$.\n\n\n\n##### Example\n\nLet $f(x,y) = x^2 - 2xy$, then to compute the partials, we just treat the other variables like a constant. (This is consistent with the view that the partial derivative is just a regular derivative along a line where all other variables are constant.)\n\nThen\n\n$$~\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{\\partial (x^2 - 2xy)}{\\partial x} &= 2x - 2y\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial (x^2 - 2xy)}{\\partial y} &= 0 - 2x = -2x.\n\\end{align}\n~$$\n\nCombining, gives $\\nabla{f} = \\langle 2x -2y, -2x \\rangle$.\n\n\n\nIf $g(x,y,z) = \\sin(x) + z\\cos(y)$, then\n\n$$~\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{\\partial g }{\\partial x} &= \\cos(x) + 0 = \\cos(x),\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial g }{\\partial y} &= 0 + z(-\\sin(y)) = -z\\sin(y),\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial g }{\\partial z} &= 0 + \\cos(y) = \\cos(y).\n\\end{align}\n~$$\n\nCombining, gives $\\nabla{g} = \\langle \\cos(x), -z\\sin(y), \\cos(y) \\rangle$.\n\n\n### Finding partial derivatives in Julia\n\n\nTwo different methods are described, one for working with functions, the other symbolic expressions. This mirrors our treatment for vector-valued functions, where `ForwardDiff.derivative` was used for functions, and `SymPy`'s `diff` function for symbolic expressions.\n\n\nSuppose, we consider $f(x,y) = x^2 - 2xy$.

        "----\n\nIn computer science there are two related concepts [Currying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying) and [Partial application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_application). For a function $f(x,y)$, say, partial application is the process of fixing one of the variables, producing a new function of fewer variables. For example, fixing $y=c$, the we get a new function (of just $x$ and not $(x,y)$) $g(x) = f(x,c)$. In partial derivatives the partial derivative of $f(x,y)$ with respect to $x$ is the derivative of the function $g$, as defined above.\n\nCurrying, is related, but technically returns a function, so we think of the curried version of $f$ as a function, $h$, which takes $x$ and returns the function $y \\rightarrow f(x,y)$ so that $h(x)(y) = f(x, y)$.\n\n\n### Visualizing the gradient\n\nThe gradient is not a univariate function, a simple vector-valued\nfunction, or a scalar function, but rather a *vector field* (which will  be\ndiscussed later). For the case, $f: R^2 \\rightarrow R$, the gradient\nwill be a function which takes a point $(x,y)$ and returns a vector ,\n$\\langle \\partial{f}/\\partial{x}(x,y), \\partial{f}/\\partial{y}(x,y) \\rangle$. We can visualize this by\nplotting a vector at several points on a grid. This task is made\neasier with a function like the following, which handles the task of vectorizing the values. It is provided within the `CalculusWithJulia` package:"

        "The figure suggests a potential geometric relationship between the gradient and the contour line to be explored later.\n\n## Differentiable\n\nWe see here how the gradient of $f$, $\\nabla{f} = \\langle f_{x_1}, f_{x_2}, \\dots, f_{x_n} \\rangle$, plays a similar role as the derivative does for univariate functions.\n\nFirst, we consider the role of the derivative for univariate functions. The main characterization - the derivative is the slope of the line that best approximates the function at a point - is quantified by Taylor's theorem. For a function $f$ with a continuous second derivative:\n\n$$~\nf(c+h) = f(c) = f'(c)h + \\frac{1}{2} f''(\\xi) h^2,\n~$$\n\nfor some $\\xi$ within $c$ and $c+h$.\n\nWe re-express this through:\n\n$$~\n(f(c+h) - f(c)) - f'(c)h  =\\frac{1}{2} f''(\\xi) h^2.\n~$$\n\nThe right hand side is the *error* term between the function value at $c+h$ and, in this case, the linear approximation at the same value.\n\n\nIf the assumptions are relaxed, and $f$ is just assumed to be *differentiable* at $x=c$, then only this is known:\n\n$$~\n(f(c+h) - f(c)) - f'(c)h  = \\epsilon(h) h,\n~$$\n\nwhere $\\epsilon(h) \\rightarrow 0$ as $h \\rightarrow 0$.\n\n\nIt is this characterization of differentiable that is generalized to define when a scalar function is *differentiable*.\n\n> Let $f$ be a scalar function.\n> Then $f$ is [differentiable](https://tinyurl.com/qj8qcbb) at a point $C$ **if** the first order partial derivatives exist at $C$ **and** for $\\vec{h}$ going to $\\vec{0}$:\n> $$~\n> \\|f(C + \\vec{h}) - f(C) - \\nabla{f}(C) \\cdot \\vec{h}\\| = \\mathcal{o}(\\|\\vec{h}\\|),\n> ~$$\n> where $ \\mathcal{o}(\\|\\vec{h}\\|) $ means that dividing the left hand side by $\\|\\vec{h}\\|$ and taking a limit as $\\vec{h}\\rightarrow 0$ the limit will be $0$..\n\n\nThe limits here are for limits of scalar functions, which means along any path going to $\\vec{0}$, not just straight line paths, as are used to define the partial derivatives. Hidden above, is an assumption that there is some open set around $C$ for which $f$ is defined for $f(C + \\vec{h})$ when $C+\\vec{h}$ is in this open set.\n\n\nThe role of the derivative in the univariate case is played by the\ngradient in the scalar case, where $f'(c)h$ is replaced by $\\nabla{f}(C) \\cdot \\vec{h}$.\nFor the univariate case, differentiable is simply\nthe derivative existing, but saying a scalar function is\ndifferentiable at $C$ is a stronger statement than saying it has a\ngradient or, equivalently, it has partial derivatives at $C$, as this is assumed\nin the statement along with the other condition.\n\nLater we will see how Taylor's theorem generalizes for scalar functions and interpret the gradient geometrically, as was done for the derivative (it being the slope of the tangent line).\n\n\n\n## The chain rule to evaluate $f\\circ\\vec\\gamma$\n\n\nIn finding a partial derivative, we restricted the surface along a curve in the $x$-$y$ plane, in this case the curve $\\vec{\\gamma}(t)=\\langle t, c\\rangle$. In general if we have a curve in the $x$-$y$ plane, $\\vec{\\gamma}(t)$, we can compose the scalar function $f$ with $\\vec{\\gamma}$ to create a univariate function. If the functions are \"smooth\" then this composed function should have a derivative, and some version of a \"chain rule\" should provide a means to compute the derivative in terms of the \"derivative\" of $f$ (the gradient) and the derivative of $\\vec{\\gamma}$ ($\\vec{\\gamma}'$).\n\n> Suppose $f$ is *differentiable* at $C$, and $\\vec{\\gamma}(t)$ is differentiable at $c$ with $\\vec{\\gamma}(c) = C$. Then $f\\circ\\vec{\\gamma}$ is differentiable at $c$ with derivative $\\nabla f(\\vec{\\gamma}(c)) \\cdot \\vec{\\gamma}'(c)$.\n\n\nThis is similar to the chain rule for univariate functions $(f\\circ g)'(u) = f'(g(u)) g'(u)$ or $df/dx = df/du \\cdot du/dx$. However, when we write out in components there are more terms. For example, for $n=2$ we have with $\\vec{\\gamma} = \\langle x(t), y(t) \\rangle$:\n\n$$~\n\\frac{d(f\\circ\\vec{\\gamma})}{dt} =\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x} \\frac{dx}{dt} +\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y} \\frac{dy}{dt}.\n~$$\n\n\nThe proof is a consequence of the definition of differentiability and\nwill be shown in more generality later.\n\n\n##### Example\n\n\nConsider the function $f(x,y) = 2 - x^2 - y^2$ and the curve $\\vec\\gamma(t) = t\\langle \\cos(t), -\\sin(t) \\rangle$ at $t=\\pi/6$. We visualize this below:"

Worth reiterating, the gradient is not on the surface, but rather is a $2$-dimensional vector, but it does indicate a direction that can be taken on the surface. We will see that this direction indicates the path of steepest ascent.\n\nThe figure suggests a relationship between the gradient and the tangents to the contour lines.\nLet's parameterize the contour line by $\\vec\\gamma(t)$, assuming such a parameterization exists, let $C = (x,y) = \\vec\\gamma(t)$, for some $t$, be a point on the level curve, and $\\vec{T} = \\vec\\gamma'(t)/\\|\\vec\\gamma'(t)\\|$ be the tangent to to the level curve at $C$. Then the directional derivative at $C$ in the direction of $T$ must be $0$, as along the level curve, the function $f\\circ \\vec\\gamma = c$, a constant. But by the chain rule, this says:\n\n$$~\n0 = (c)' = (f\\circ\\vec\\gamma)'(t) = \\nabla{f}(\\vec\\gamma(t)) \\cdot \\vec\\gamma'(t)\n~$$\n\nThat is the gradient is *orthogonal* to $\\vec{\\gamma}'(t)$. As well, is orthogonal to the tangent vector $\\vec{T}$ and hence to the level curve at any point. (As the dot product is $0$.)\n\n\nNow, consider a unit vector $\\vec{v}$ in the direction of steepest ascent at $C$. Since $\\nabla{f}(C)$ and $\\vec{T}$ are orthogonal, we can express the unit vector uniquely as $a\\nabla{f}(C) + b \\vec{T}$ with $a^2 + b^2 = 1$. The directional derivative is then\n\n$$~\n\\nabla{f} \\cdot \\vec{v} = \\nabla{f}  \\cdot (a\\nabla{f}(C) + b \\vec{T}) = a \\| \\nabla{f} \\|^2  + b \\nabla{f} \\cdot \\vec{T} = a \\| \\nabla{f} \\|^2.\n~$$\n\nThe will be largest when $a=1$ and $b=0$. That is, the direction of greatest ascent in indicated by the gradient. (It is smallest when $a=-1$ and $b=0$, the direction opposite the gradient.\n\nIn practical terms, if standing on a hill, walking in the direction of\nthe gradient will go uphill the fastest possible way, walking along a\ncontour will not gain any elevation. The two directions are orthogonal.\n\n\n\n## Other types of compositions and the chain rule\n\nThe chain rule we discussed was for a composition of $f:R^n \\rightarrow R$ with $\\vec\\gamma:R \\rightarrow R^n$ resulting in a function $f\\circ\\vec\\gamma:R \\rightarrow R$. There are other possible compositions.\n\nFor example, suppose we have an economic model for beverage consumption based on temperature given by $c(T)$. But temperature depends on geographic location, so may be modeled through a function $T(x,y)$. The composition $c \\circ T$ would be a function from $R^2 \\rightarrow R$, so should have partial derivatives with respect to $x$ and $y$ which should be expressible in terms of the derivative of $c$ and the partial derivatives of $T$.\n\nConsider a different situation, say we have $f(x,y)$ a scalar function, but want to consider the position in polar coordinates involving $r$ and $\\theta$. We can think directly of $F(r,\\theta) = f(r\\cdot\\cos(\\theta), r\\cdot\\sin(\\theta))$, but more generally, we have a function $G(r, \\theta)$ that is vector valued: $G(r,\\theta) = \\langle r\\cdot\\cos(\\theta), r\\cdot\\sin(\\theta) \\rangle$ ($G:R^2 \\rightarrow R^2$). The composition $F=f\\circ G$ is a scalar function of $r$ and $\\theta$ and the partial derivatives with respect to these should be expressible in terms of the partial derivatives of $f$ and the partial derivatives of $G$.\n\nFinding the derivative of a composition in terms of the individual pieces involves some form of the chain rule, which will differ depending on the exact circumstances.\n\n\n### Chain rule for a univariate function composed with a scalar function\n\nIf $f(t)$ is a univariate function and $G(x,y)$ a scalar function, the $F(x,y) = f(G(x,y))$ will be a scalar function and may have partial derivatives. If $f$ and $G$ are differentiable at a point $P$, then\n\n$$~\n\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial x} = f'(G(x,y)) \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial x}, \\quad\n\\frac{\\partial F}{\\partial y} = f'(G(x,y)) \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial y},\n~$$\n\nand\n\n$$~\n\\nabla{F} = \\nabla{f \\circ G} = f'(G(x,y)) \\nabla{G}(x,y).\n~$$\n\nThe result is an immediate application of the univariate chain rule, when the partial functions are considered.\n\n##### Example\n\nImagine a scenario where sales of some commodity (say ice) depend on the temperature which in turn depends on location. Formally, we might have functions $S(T)$ and $T(x,y)$ and then sales would be the composition $S(T(x,y))$. How might sales go up or down if one moved west, or one moved in the northwest direction? These would be a *directional* derivative, answered by $\\nabla{S}\\cdot \\hat{v}$, where $\\vec{v}$ is the direction. Of importance would be to compute $\\nabla{S}$ which might best be done through the chain rule.\n\nFor example, if $S(T) = \\exp((T - 70)/10)$ and $T(x,y) = (1-x^2)\\cdot y$, the gradient of $S(T(x,y))$ would be given by:\n\n$$~\nS'(T(x,y)) \\nabla{T}(x,y) = (S(T(x,y))/10) \\langle(-2xy, 1-x^2 \\rangle.\n~$$\n\n\n\n\n### Chain rule for a scalar function, $f$, composed with a function $G: R^m \\rightarrow R^n$.\n\nIf $G(u_1, \\dots, u_m) = \\langle G_1, G_2,\\dots, G_n\\rangle$ is a function of $m$ inputs that returns $n$ outputs we may view it as $G: R^m \\rightarrow R^n$. The composition with a scalar function $f(v_1, v_2, \\dots, v_n)=z$ from $R^n \\rightarrow R$ creates a scalar function from $R^m \\rightarrow R$, so the question of partial derivatives is of interest. We have:\n\n$$~\n\\frac{\\partial (f \\circ G)}{\\partial u_i} =\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial v_1} \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial u_i} +\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial v_2} \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial u_i} + \\dots +\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial v_n} \\frac{\\partial G}{\\partial u_i}.\n~$$\n\nThe gradient is then:\n\n$$~\n\\nabla(f\\circ G) =\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial v_1} \\nabla{G_1} +\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial v_2} \\nabla{G_2} + \\dots +\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial v_n} \\nabla{G_n} = \\nabla(f) \\cdot \\langle \\nabla{G_1}, \\nabla{G_2}, \\dots, \\nabla{G_n} \\rangle,\n~$$\n\nThe last expression is a suggestion, as it is an abuse of previously used notation: the dot product isn't between vectors of the same type, as the rightmost vector is representing a vector of vectors.\nThe [Jacobian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobian_matrix_and_determinant) matrix combines these vectors into a rectangular array, though with the vectors written as *row* vectors. If $G: R^m \\rightarrow R^n$, then the Jacobian is the $n \\times m$ matrix\nwith $(i,j)$ entry given by $\\partial G_i, \\partial u_j$:\n\n$$~\nJ = \\left[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{\\partial G_1}{\\partial u_1} & \\frac{\\partial G_1}{\\partial u_2} & \\dots \\frac{\\partial G_1}{\\partial u_m}\\\\\n\\frac{\\partial G_2}{\\partial u_1} & \\frac{\\partial G_2}{\\partial u_2} & \\dots \\frac{\\partial G_2}{\\partial u_m}\\\\\n& \\vdots & \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial G_n}{\\partial u_1} & \\frac{\\partial G_n}{\\partial u_2} & \\dots \\frac{\\partial G_n}{\\partial u_m}\n\\end{align}\n\\right].\n~$$\n\nWith this notation, and matrix multiplication we have $(\\nabla(f\\circ G))^t = \\nabla(f)^t J$.\n\n\n(Later, we will see that the chain rule in general has a familiar form using matrices, not vectors, which will avoid the need for a transpose.)\n\n##### Example\n\nLet $f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2$ be a scalar function. We have if $G(r, \\theta) = \\langle r\\cos(\\theta)(, r\\sin(\\theta) \\rangle$ then after simplification, we have $(f \\circ G)(r, \\theta) = r^2$. Clearly then $\\partial(f\\circ G)/\\partial r = 2r$ and $\\partial(f\\circ G)/\\partial \\theta = 0$.\n\nWere this computed through the chain rule, we have:\n\n$$~\n\\begin{align}\n\\nabla G_1 &= \\langle \\frac{\\partial r\\cos(\\theta)}{\\partial r}, \\frac{\\partial r\\cos(\\theta)}{\\partial \\theta} \\rangle=\n\\langle \\cos(\\theta), -r \\sin(\\theta) \\rangle,\\\\\n\\nabla G_2 &= \\langle \\frac{\\partial r\\sin(\\theta)}{\\partial r}, \\frac{\\partial r\\sin(\\theta)}{\\partial \\theta}  \\rangle=\n\\langle \\sin(\\theta), r \\cos(\\theta) \\rangle.\n\\end{align}\n~$$\n\nWe have $\\partial f/\\partial x = 2x$ and  $\\partial f/\\partial y = 2y$, which at $G$ are $2r\\cos(\\theta)$ and $2r\\sin(\\theta)$, so by the chain rule, we should have\n\n$$~\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{\\partial (f\\circ G)}{\\partial r} &=\n\\frac{\\partial{f}}{\\partial{x}}\\frac{\\partial G_1}{\\partial r} +\n\\frac{\\partial{f}}{\\partial{y}}\\frac{\\partial G_2}{\\partial r} =\n2r\\cos(\\theta) \\cos(\\theta) + 2r\\sin(\\theta) \\sin(\\theta) =\n2r (\\cos^2(\\theta) + \\sin^2(\\theta)) = 2r, \\\\\n\\frac{\\partial (f\\circ G)}{\\partial \\theta} &=\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}\\frac{\\partial G_1}{\\partial \\theta} +\n\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}\\frac{\\partial G_2}{\\partial \\theta} =\n2r\\cos(\\theta)(-r\\sin(\\theta)) + 2r\\sin(\\theta)(r\\cos(\\theta)) = 0.\n\\end{align}\n~$$\n\n\n## Higher order partial derivatives\n\nIf $f:R^n \\rightarrow R$, the $\\partial f/\\partial x_i$ takes $R^n \\rightarrow R$ too, so may also have a partial derivative.\n\nConsider the case $f: R^2 \\rightarrow R$, then there are $4$ possible partial derivatives of order 2: partial in $x$ then $x$, partial in $x$ then $y$, partial in $y$ and then $x$, and, finally, partial in $y$ and then $y$.\n\n\nThe notation for the partial in $y$ *of* the partial in $x$ is:\n\n$$~\n\\frac{\\partial^2 f}{\\partial{y}\\partial{x}} = \\frac{\\partial{\\frac{\\partial{f}}{\\partial{x}}}}{\\partial{y}} = \\frac{\\partial f_x}{\\partial{y}} = f_{xy}.\n~$$\n\nThe placement of $x$ and $y$ indicating the order is different in the two notations.\n\n\nWe can compute these for an example easily enough:"

Two rules of thumb are 1) the trail should not be steeper than 10 degrees 2) the outward slope (in the steepest downhill direction) should be around 5%.

In the best possible world, the outslope will exceed the downward slope.)\n\nSuppose a trail height is described parametrically by a composition $(f \\circ \\vec\\gamma)(t))$, where $\\vec\\gamma(t) = \\langle x(t),y(t)\\rangle$. The vector $\\vec{T}(t) = \\langle x(t), y(t), \\nabla{f}(\\vec\\gamma(t)) \\rangle$ describes the tangent to the trail at a point ($\\vec\\gamma(t)$).
