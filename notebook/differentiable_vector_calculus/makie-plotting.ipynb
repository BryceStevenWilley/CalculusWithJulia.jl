        "The [Makie.jl webpage](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Makie.jl) says\n\n> From the Jpanese word Maki-e, which is a technique to sprinkle lacquer with gold and silver powder. Data is basically the gold and silver of our age, so let's spread it out beautifully on the screen!\n\n`Makie` itself is a metapackage for a rich ecosystem. We show how to\nuse the interface provided by `AbstractPlotting` and the `GLMakie`\nbackend to produce the familiar graphics of calculus.  We do not\ndiscuss the `MakieLayout` package which provides a means to layout\nmultiple graphics and add widgets, such as sliders and buttons, to a\nlayout. We do not discuss `MakieRecipes`. For `Plots`, there are\n\"recipes\" that make some of the plots more straightforward.  We do not\ndiscuss the\n[`AlgebraOfGraphics`](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/AlgebraOfGraphics.jl)\nwhich presents an interface for the familiar graphics of statistics. The [`MakieGallery`](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/MakieGallery.jl) shows many exmaples of the use of `Makie`.\n\n\n## Scenes\n\nMakie draws graphics onto a canvas termed a \"scene\" in the Makie documentation. There are `GLMakie`, `WGLMakie`, and `CairoMakie` backends for different types of canvases. In the following, we have used `GLMakie`. `WGLMakie` is useful for incorporating `Makie` plots into web-based technologies.\n\nWe begin by loading our two packages:"

The rows are associated with the points, and these too can be used to produce the same graphic.\nRather than make vectors of $x$ and $y$ (and optionally $z$) coordinates, it is more idiomatic to create a vector of \"points.\" `Makie` utilizes a `Point` type to store a 2 or 3 dimensional point. The `Point2` and `Point3` constructors will be utilized. \n\n`Makie` uses a GPU, when present, to accelerate the graphic rendering. GPUs employ 32-bit numbers. Julia uses an `f0` to indicate 32-bit floating points. Hence the alternate types `Point2f0` to store 2D points as 32-bit numbers and `Points3f0` to store 3D points as 32-bit numbers are seen in the documentation for Makie.\n\n\nWe can plot vector of points in as direct manner as vectors of their coordinates:"

This is more general than the graph of a function, which can be viewed as the graph of the equation $y=f(x)$. An equation in $x$-$y$ can be graphed if the set of solutions to a related equation $f(x,y)=0$ can be identified, as one can move all terms to one side of an equation and define $f$ as the rule of the side with the terms.\n\nThe [MDBM](https://github.com/bachrathyd/MDBM.jl) (Multi-Dimensional Bisection Method) package can be used for the task of characterizing when $f(x,y)=0$. (Also `IntervalConstraintProgramming` can be used.) We first wrap its interface and then define a \"`plot`\" recipe (through method overloading, not through `MakieRecipes`)."

        "(The viewing range could also be adjusted with the `-5..5` notation from the `IntervalSets` package which is brought in when `AbstractPlotting` is loaded.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## Interacting with a scene\n\n[Interaction](http://makie.juliaplots.org/stable/interaction.html) with a scene is very much integrated into `Makie`, as the design has a \"sophisticated referencing system\" which allows sharing of attributes. Adjusting one attribute, can then propogate to others.\n\n\nIn Makie, a `Node` is a structure that allows its value to be updated, similar to an array.\nNodes are `Observables`, which when changed can trigger an event. Nodes can rely on other nodes, so events can be cascaded.\n\nA simple example is a means to dynamically adjust a label for a scene.\n\n```\nxs, = 1:5, rand(5)\nscene = scatter(xs, ys)\n```\n\nWe can create a \"Node\" through:\n\n```\nx = Node(\"x values\")\n```\n\nThe value of the node is retrieved by `x[]`, though the function call `to_value(x)` is recommened, as it will be defined even when `x` is not a node. This stored value could be used to set the $x$-label in our scene:\n\n```\nxlabel!(scene, x[])\n```\n\nWe now set up an observer to update the label whenever the value of `x` is updated:\n\n```\non(x) do val\n   xlabel!(scen, val)\nend\n```\n\nNow setting the value of `x` will also update the label:\n\n```\nx[] = \"The x axis\"\n```\n\n\nA node can be more complicated. This shows how a node of $x$ value can be used to define dependent $y$ values. A scatter plot will update when the $x$ values are updated:\n\n```\nxs = Node(1:10)\nys = lift(a -> f.(a), xs)\n```\n\nThe `lift` function lifts the values of `xs` to the values of `ys`.\n\nThese can be plotted directly:\n\n```\nscene =  lines(xs, ys)\n```\n\nChanges to the `xs` values will be reflected in the `scene`.\n\n```\nxs[] = 2:9\n```\n\nWe can incoporporate the two:\n\n```\nlab = lift(val -> \"Showing from $(val.start) to $(val.stop)\", xs)\non(lab) do val\n  xlabel!(scene, val)\n  udpate!(scene)\nend\n```\n\nThe `update!` call redraws the scene to adjust to increased or decreased range of $x$ values.\n\n\nThe mouse position can be recorded. An example in the gallery of examples shows how.\n\nHere is a hint:\n\n```\nscene = lines(1:5, rand(5))\npos = lift(scene.events.mouseposition) do mpos\n    @show AbstractPlotting.to_world(scene, Point2f0(mpos))\nend\n```\n\nThis will display the coordinates of the mouse in the terminal, as the mouse is moved around."
