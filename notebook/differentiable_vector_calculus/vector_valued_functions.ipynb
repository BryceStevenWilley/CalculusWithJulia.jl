        "## Definition\n\nA function $\\vec{f}: R \\rightarrow R^n$, $n > 1$ is called a vector valued function. Some examples:\n\n$$~\n\\vec{f}(t) = \\langle \\sin(t), 2\\cos(t) \\rangle, \\quad\n\\vec{g}(t) = \\langle \\sin(t), \\cos(t), t \\rangle, \\quad\n\\vec{h}(t) = \\langle 2, 3 \\rangle + t \\cdot \\langle 1, 2 \\rangle.\n~$$\n\nThe components themselves are also functions of $t$, in this case\nunivariate functions. Depending on the context, it can be useful to\nview vector-valued functions as a function that returns a vector, or a\nvector of the component functions.\n\n\nThe above example functions have $n$ equal $2$, $3$, and $2$ respectively. We\nwill see that many concepts of calculus for univariate functions\n($n=1$) have direct counterparts.\n\n\n## Representation in Julia\n\nIn `Julia`, the representation of a vector-valued function is straightforward: we define a function of a single variable that returns a vector.

        "We can create a vector of functions, e.g., `F = [cos, sin, identify]`, but calling this object, as in `F(t)`, would require some work, such as `t = 1; [f(t) for f in F]`.\n\n\n\n\n## Space curves\n\nA vector-valued function is typically visualized as a\ncurve. That is, for some range, $a \\leq t \\leq b$ the set of points\n$\\{\\vec{f}(t): a \\leq t \\leq b\\}$ are plotted. If, say in $n=2$, we\nhave $x(t)$ and $y(t)$ as the component functions, then the graph\nwould also be the parametric plot of $x$ and $y$. The term *planar* curve is common for the $n=2$ case and *space* curve for the $n \\geq 3$ case.\n\n\nThis plot represents the vectors with their tails at the origin.\n\nThere is a convention for plotting the component functions to yield a parametric plot within the `Plots` package (e.g., `plot(x, y, a, b)`). This can be used to make polar plots, where `x` is  `t -> r(t)*cos(t)` and `y` is `t -> r(t)*sin(t)`.\n\nHowever,  we will use a different approach, as the component functions are not naturally produced from the vector-valued function.\n\nIn `Plots`, the command `plot(xs, ys)`, where, say, `xs=[x1, x2, ..., xn]` and `ys=[y1, y2, ..., yn]`, will make a connect-the-dot plot between corresponding pairs of points. This can be used as an alternative to plotting a function through `plot(f, a, b)`: first make a set of $x$ values, say `xs=range(a, b, length=100)`; then the corresponding $y$ values, say `ys = f.(xs)`; and then plotting through `plot(xs, ys)`. (If using `Julia 1.0` the second argument to `range` should be named, as in `stop=b`.)\n\nSimilarly, were a third vector, ` zs`, for $z$ components used, `plot(xs, ys, zs)` will make a 3-dimensional connect the dot plot\n\nHowever, our representation of vector-valued functions naturally generates a vector of points: `[[x1,y1], [x2, y2], ..., [xn, yn]]`, as this comes from broadcasting `f` over some time values.\nThat is, for a collection of time values, `ts`, typically generated, as above, by `range`, the command `f.(ts)` will produce the vector of points.\n\nTo get the `xs` and `ys` from this, is conceptually easy: just iterate over all the points and extract the corresponding component. For example, to get `xs` we would have a command like `[p[1] for p in f.(ts)]`. Similarly, the `ys` would use `p[2]` in place of `p[1]`. The following  function, from the `CalculusWithJulia` package and employed  previously, does this for us, returning the vectors in a tuple:"

        "##### Example\n\nFamiliarity with equations for lines, circles, and ellipses is\nimportant, as these fundamental geometric shapes are often building\nblocks in the description of other more complicated things.\n\nThe point-slope equation of a line, $y = y_0 + m \\cdot (x - x_0)$\nfinds an analog. The slope, $m$, is replaced with a vector $\\vec{v}$\nand the point, $(x_0, y_0)$ is replaced with a vector $\\vec{p}$\nidentified with a point in the plane. A parameterization would then be\n$f(t) = \\vec{p} + (t - t_0) \\vec{v}$. From this, we have $f(t_0) =\n\\vec{p}$.\n\n\n\n\nThe unit circle is instrumental in introducing the trigonometric\nfunctions though the identification of and angle $t$ with a point on\nthe unit circle $(x,y)$ through $y = \\sin(t)$ and $x=\\cos(t)$. With\nthis identification certain properties of the trigonometric functions\nare immediately seen, such as the period of $\\sin$ and $\\cos$ being\n$2\\pi$, or the angles for which $\\sin$ and $\\cos$ are positive or even\nincreasing. Further, this gives a natural parameterization for a\nvector-valued function whose plot yields the unit circle, namely\n$\\vec{f}(t) = \\langle \\cos(t), \\sin(t) \\rangle$. This\nparameterization starts (at $t=0$) at the point $(1, 0)$. More\ngenerally, we might have additional parameters $\\vec{f}(t) = \\vec{p} +\nR \\cdot \\langle \\cos(\\omega(t-t_0)), \\sin(\\omega(t-t_0)) \\rangle$ to\nchange the origin, $\\vec{p}$; the radius, $R$; the starting angle,\n$t_0$; and the rotational frequency, $\\omega$.\n\n\nAn ellipse has a slightly more general equation than a circle and in\nsimplest forms may satisfy the equation $x^2/a^2 +  y^2/b^2 = 1$, where *when*\n$a=b$ a circle is being described. A vector-valued function of the form\n$\\vec{f}(t) = \\langle a\\cdot\\cos(t),  b\\cdot\\sin(t) \\rangle$ will trace out an ellipse.\n\n\nThe above description of an ellipse is useful, but it can also be useful to re-express the ellipse so that one of the foci is at the origin. With this, the ellipse can be given in *polar* coordinates through a description of the radius:\n\n$$~\nr(\\theta) = \\frac{a (1 - e^2)}{1 + e \\cos(\\theta)}.\n~$$\n\nHere, $a$ is the semi-major axis ($a > b$); $e$ is the *eccentricity* given by $b = a \\sqrt{1 - e^2}$; and $\\theta$ a polar angle.\n\nUsing the conversion to Cartesian equations, we have\n$\\vec{x}(\\theta) = \\langle r(\\theta) \\cos(\\theta), r(\\theta) \\sin(\\theta)\\rangle$.\n\nFor example:"

It was developed by British engineer Denys Fisher and first sold in 1965.\" These can be used to make interesting geometrical curves.\n\nFollowing Wikipedia: Consider a fixed outer circle $C_o$ of radius $R$ centered at the origin. A smaller inner circle  $C_i$ of radius $r < R$ rolling inside $C_o$ and is continuously tangent to it. $C_i$ will be assumed never to slip on $C_o$ (in a real Spirograph, teeth on both circles prevent such slippage). Now assume that a point $A$ lying somewhere inside $C_{i}$is located a distance $\\rho < r$ from $C_i$'s center.\n\nThe center of the inner circle will move in a circular manner with radius $R-r$. The fixed point on the inner circle will rotate about this center. The accumulated angle may be described by the angle the point of contact of the inner circle with the outer circle. Call this angle $t$.\n\nSuppose the outer circle is centered at the origin and the inner circle starts ($t=0$) with center $(R-r, 0)$ and rotates around counterclockwise. Then if the point of contact makes angle $t$, the arc length along the outer circle is $Rt$. The inner circle will have moved a distance $r t'$ in the opposite direction, so $Rt =-r t'$ and solving the angle will be $t' = -(R/r)t$.\n\nIf the initial position of the fixed point is at $(\\rho, 0)$ relative to the origin, then the following function will describe the motion:\n\n$$~\n\\vec{s}(t) = (R-r) \\cdot \\langle \\cos(t), \\sin(t) \\rangle +\n\\rho \\cdot \\langle \\cos(-\\frac{R}{r}t), \\sin(-\\frac{R}{r}t) \\rangle.\n~$$\n\n\n\nTo visualize this we first define a helper function to draw a circle at point $P$ with radius $R$:"

        "### Applications of the derivative\n\nHere are some sample applications of the derivative.\n\n##### Example: equation of the tangent line\nThe derivative of a vector-valued function is similar to that of a univariate function, in that it indicates a direction tangent to a curve. The point-slope form offers a straightforward parameterization. We have a point given through the vector-valued function and a direction given by its derivative. (After identifying a vector with its tail at the origin with the point that is the head of the vector.)\n\nWith this, the equation is simply $\\vec{tl}(t) = \\vec{f}(t_0) + \\vec{f}'(t_0) \\cdot (t - t_0)$, where the dot indicates scalar multiplication.\n\n\n\n##### Example: parabolic motion\n\nIn physics, we learn that the equation $F=ma$ can be used to derive a formula for postion, when acceleration, $a$, is a constant. The resulting equation of motion is $x = x_0 + v_0t + (1/2) at^2$. Similarly, if $x(t)$ is a vector-valued postion vector, and the *second* derivative, $x''(t) =\\vec{a}$, a constant, then we have: $x(t) = \\vec{x_0} + \\vec{v_0}t + (1/2) \\vec{a} t^2$.\n\nFor two dimensions, we have the force due to gravity acts downward, only in the $y$ direction. The acceleration is then $\\vec{a} = \\langle 0, -g \\rangle$. If we start at the origin, with initial velocity $\\vec{v_0} = \\langle 2, 3\\rangle$, then we can plot the trajectory until the object returns to ground ($y=0$) as follows:"

        "A [tractrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tractrix), studied by Perrault, Newton, Huygens, and many others, is the curve along which an object moves when pulled in a horizontal plane by a line segment attached to a pulling point (Wikipedia). If the object is placed at $(a,0)$ and the puller at the origin, and the puller moves along the positive $x$ axis, then the line will always be tangent to the curve and of fixed length, so determinable from the motion of the puller. In this example $dy/dx = -\\sqrt{a^2-x^2}/x$.\n\nThis is the key property: \"Due to the geometrical way it was defined, the tractrix has the property that the segment of its tangent, between the asymptote and the point of tangency, has constant length $a$.\"\n\n\nThe tracks made by the front and rear bicycle wheels also have this\nsame property and similarly afford a mathematical description. We follow\n[Dunbar, Bosman, and Nooij](https://doi.org/10.2307/2691097) from *The\nTrack of a Bicycle Back Tire* below, though\n[Levi and Tabachnikov](https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.em/1259158427)\nand\n[Foote, Levi, and Tabachnikov](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.4169/amer.math.monthly.120.03.199)\nwere also consulted.  Let $a$ be the distance between the front and\nback wheels, whose positions are parameterized by $\\vec{F}(t)$ and\n$\\vec{B}(t)$, respectively. The key property is the distance between\nthe two is always $a$, and, as the back wheel is always moving in the\ndirection of the front wheel, we have $\\vec{B}'(t)$ is in the\ndirection of $\\vec{F}(t) - \\vec{B}(t)$, that is the vector\n$(\\vec{F}(t)-\\vec{B}(t))/a$ is a unit vector in the direction of the\nderivative of $\\vec{B}$. How long is the derivative vector? That would\nbe answered by the speed of the back wheel, which is related to the\nvelocity of the front wheel. But only the component of the velocity in\nthe direction of $\\vec{F}(t)-\\vec{B}(t)$, so the speed of the back\nwheel is the length of the projection of $\\vec{F}'(t)$ onto the unit\nvector $(\\vec{F}(t)-\\vec{B}(t))/a$, which is identified through the dot product.\n\nCombined, this gives the following equations relating $\\vec{F}(t)$ to $\\vec{B}(t)$:\n\n$$~\ns_B(t) = \\vec{F}'(t) \\cdot \\frac{\\vec{F}(t)-\\vec{B}(t)}{a}, \\quad\n\\vec{B}'(t) = s_B(t) \\frac{\\vec{F}(t)-\\vec{B}(t)}{a}.\n~$$\n\nThis is a *differential* equation describing the motion of the back wheel in terms of the front wheel.\n\nIf the back wheel trajectory is known, the relationship is much easier, as the two differ by a vector of length $a$ in the direction of $\\vec{B}'(t)$, or:\n\n$$~\nF(t) = \\vec{B}(t) + a \\frac{\\vec{B'(t)}}{\\|\\vec{B}'(t)\\|}.\n~$$\n\n\nWe don't discuss when a differential equation has a solution, or if it\nis unique when it does, but note that the differential equation above\nmay be solved numerically, in a manner somewhat similar to what was\ndiscussed in [ODEs](../ODEs/odes.html). Though here we will use the\n`DifferentialEquations` package for finding the numeric solution.\n\nWe can define our equation as follows, using `p` to pass in the two parameters: the wheel-base length $a$, and $F(t)$, the parameterization of the front wheel in time:"

        "In summary, these two derivative formulas hold for vector-valued functions $R \\rightarrow R^n$:\n\n$$~\n\\begin{align}\n(\\vec{u} \\cdot \\vec{v})' &= \\vec{u}' \\cdot \\vec{v} + \\vec{u} \\cdot \\vec{v}',\\\\\n(\\vec{u} \\times \\vec{v})' &= \\vec{u}' \\times \\vec{v} + \\vec{u} \\times \\vec{v}'.\n\\end{align}\n~$$\n\n##### Application. Circular motion and the tangent vector.\n\nThe parameterization $\\vec{r}(t) = \\langle \\cos(t), \\sin(t) \\rangle$ describes a circle. Characteristic of this motion is a constant radius, or in terms of a norm: $\\| \\vec{r}(t) \\| = c$. The norm squared, can be expressed in terms of the dot product:\n\n$$~\n\\| \\vec{r}(t) \\|^2 = \\vec{r}(t) \\cdot \\vec{r}(t).\n~$$\n\nDifferentiating this for the case of a constant radius yields the\nequation $0 = [\\vec{r}\\cdot\\vec{r}]'(t)$, which simplifies through the\nproduct rule and commutativity of the dot product to $0 = 2 \\vec{r}(t)\n\\cdot \\vec{r}'(t)$. That is, the two vectors are orthogonal to each\nother. This observation proves to be very useful, as will be seen.\n\n\n##### Example: Kepler's laws\n\n[Kepler](https://tinyurl.com/y38wragh)'s laws of planetary motion are summarized by:\n\n* The orbit of a planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the two foci.\n\n* A line segment joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time.\n\n* The square of the orbital period of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit.\n\nKepler was a careful astronomer, and derived these laws empirically.\nWe show next how to derive these laws using vector calculus assuming some facts on Newtonian motion, as postulated by Newton. This approach is borrowed from [Joyce](https://mathcs.clarku.edu/~djoyce/ma131/kepler.pdf).\n\nWe adopt a sun-centered view of the universe, placing the sun at the origin and letting $\\vec{x}(t)$ be the position of a planet relative to this origin. We can express this in terms of a magnitude and direction through $r(t) \\hat{x}(t)$.\n\nNewton's law of gravitational force between the sun and this planet is then expressed by:\n\n\n$$~\n\\vec{F} = -\\frac{G M m}{r^2} \\hat{x}(t).\n~$$\n\nNewton's famous law relating force and acceleration is\n\n$$~\n\\vec{F} = m \\vec{a} = m \\ddot{\\vec{x}}.\n~$$\n\nCombining, Newton states $\\vec{a} = -(GM/r^2) \\hat{x}$.\n\nNow to show the first law. Consider $\\vec{x} \\times \\vec{v}$. It is constant, as:\n\n$$~\n\\begin{align}\n(\\vec{x} \\times \\vec{v})' &= \\vec{x}' \\times \\vec{v} + \\vec{x} \\times \\vec{v}'\\\\\n&= \\vec{v} \\times \\vec{v} + \\vec{x} \\times \\vec{a}.\n\\end{align}\n~$$\n\nBoth terms are $\\vec{0}$, as $\\vec{a}$ is parallel to $\\vec{x}$ by the above, and clearly $\\vec{v}$ is parallel to itself.\n\nThis says, $\\vec{x} \\times \\vec{v} = \\vec{c}$ is a constant vector, meaning, the motion of $\\vec{x}$ must lie in a plane, as $\\vec{x}$ is always orthogonal to the fixed vector $\\vec{c}$.\n\nNow, by differentiating $\\vec{x} = r \\hat{x}$ we have:\n\n$$~\n\\begin{align}\n\\vec{v} &= \\vec{x}'\\\\\n&= (r\\hat{x})'\\\\\n&= r' \\hat{x} + r \\hat{x}',\n\\end{align}\n~$$\n\nand so\n\n$$~\n\\begin{align}\n\\vec{c} &= \\vec{x} \\times \\vec{v}\\\\\n&= (r\\hat{x}) \\times (r'\\hat{x} + r \\hat{x}')\\\\\n&= r^2 (\\hat{x} \\times \\hat{x}').\n\\end{align}\n~$$\n\nFrom this, we can compute $\\vec{a} \\times \\vec{c}$:\n\n$$~\n\\begin{align}\n\\vec{a} \\times \\vec{c} &= (-\\frac{GM}{r^2})\\hat{x} \\times r^2(\\hat{x} \\times \\hat{x}')\\\\\n&= -GM \\hat{x} \\times (\\hat{x} \\times \\hat{x}') \\\\\n&= GM (\\hat{x} \\times \\hat{x}')\\times \\hat{x}.\n\\end{align}\n~$$\n\nThe last line by anti-commutativity.\n\nBut, the triple cross product can be simplified through the identify\n$(\\vec{u}\\times\\vec{v})\\times\\vec{w} = (\\vec{u}\\cdot\\vec{w})\\vec{v} - (\\vec{v}\\cdot\\vec{w})\\vec{u}$. So, the above becomes:\n\n$$~\n\\begin{align}\n\\vec{a} \\times \\vec{c} &=  GM ((\\hat{x}\\cdot\\hat{x})\\hat{x}' - (\\hat{x} \\cdot \\hat{x}')\\hat{x})\\\\\n&= GM (1 \\hat{x}' - 0 \\hat{x}).\n\\end{align}\n~$$\n\nNow, since $\\vec{c}$ is constant, we have:\n\n$$~\n\\begin{align}\n(\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{c})' &= (\\vec{a} \\times \\vec{c})\\\\\n&= GM \\hat{x}'\\\\\n&= (GM\\hat{x})'.\n\\end{align}\n~$$\n\nThe two sides have the same derivative, hence differ by a constant:\n\n$$~\n\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{c} = GM \\hat{x} + \\vec{d}.\n~$$\n\nAs $\\vec{u}$ and $\\vec{v}\\times\\vec{c}$ lie in the same plane - orthogonal to $\\vec{c}$ - so does $\\vec{d}$. With a suitable re-orientation, so that $\\vec{d}$ is along the $x$ axis, $\\vec{c}$ is along the $z$-axis, then we have $\\vec{c} = \\langle 0,0,c\\rangle$ and $\\vec{d} = \\langle d ,0,0 \\rangle$, and $\\vec{x} = \\langle x, y, 0 \\rangle$. Set $\\theta$ to be the angle, then $\\hat{x} = \\langle \\cos(\\theta), \\sin(\\theta), 0\\rangle$.\n\nNow\n\n$$~\n\\begin{align}\nc^2 &= \\|\\vec{c}\\|^2 \\\\\n&= \\vec{c} \\cdot \\vec{c}\\\\\n&= (\\vec{x} \\times \\vec{v}) \\cdot \\vec{c}\\\\\n&= \\vec{x} \\cdot (\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{c})\\\\\n&= r\\hat{x} \\cdot (GM\\hat{x} + \\vec{d})\\\\\n&= GMr + r \\hat{x} \\cdot \\vec{d}\\\\\n&= GMr + rd \\cos(\\theta).\n\\end{align}\n~$$\n\nSolving, this gives the radial distance in the form of an ellipse:\n\n$$~\nr = \\frac{c^2}{GM + d\\cos(\\theta)} =\n\\frac{c^2/(GM)}{1 + (d/GM) \\cos(\\theta)}.\n~$$\n\n\n\nKepler's second law can also be derived from vector calculus. This derivation follows that given at [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-02sc-multivariable-calculus-fall-2010/1.-vectors-and-matrices/part-c-parametric-equations-for-curves/session-21-keplers-second-law/MIT18_02SC_MNotes_k.pdf) [OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-02sc-multivariable-calculus-fall-2010/index.htm).\n\nThe second law states that the area being swept out during a time duration only depends on the duration of time, not the time. Let $\\Delta t$ be this duration. Then if $\\vec{x}(t)$ is the position vector, as above, we have the area swept out between $t$ and $t + \\Delta t$ is visualized along the lines of:"

        "The area swept out, is basically the half the area of the parallelogram formed by $\\vec{x}(t)$ and $\\Delta \\vec{x}(t) = \\vec{x}(t + \\Delta t) - \\vec{x}(t))$. This area is $(1/2) (\\vec{x} \\times \\Delta\\vec{x}(t))$.\n\nIf we divide through by $\\Delta t$, and take a limit we have:\n\n$$~\n\\frac{dA}{dt} = \\| \\frac{1}{2}\\lim_{\\Delta t \\rightarrow 0} (\\vec{x} \\times \\frac{\\vec{x}(t + \\Delta t) - \\vec{x}(t)}{\\Delta t})\\| =\n\\frac{1}{2}\\|\\vec{x} \\times \\vec{v}\\|.\n~$$\n\nBut we saw above, that for the motion of a planet, that $\\vec{x} \\times \\vec{v} = \\vec{c}$, a constant. This says, $dA$ is a constant independent of $t$, and consequently, the area swept out over a duration of time will not depend on the particular times involved, just the duration.\n\n\nThe third law relates the period to a parameter of the ellipse. We have from the above a strong suggestion that area of the ellipse can be found by integrating $dA$ over the period, say $T$. Assuming that is the case and letting $a$ be the semi-major axis length, and $b$ the semi-minor axis length, then\n\n$$~\n\\pi a b = \\int_0^T dA = \\int_0^T (1/2) \\|\\vec{x} \\times \\vec{v}\\| dt = \\| \\vec{x} \\times \\vec{v}\\| \\frac{T}{2}.\n~$$\n\nAs $c = \\|\\vec{x} \\times \\vec{v}\\|$ is a constant, this allows us to express $c$ by: $2\\pi a b/T$.\n\nBut, we have\n\n$$~\nr(\\theta) = \\frac{c^2}{GM + d\\cos(\\theta)} = \\frac{c^2/(GM)}{1 + d/(GM) \\cos(\\theta)}.\n~$$\n\nSo, $e = d/(GM)$ and $a (1 - e^2) = c^2/(GM)$. Using $b = a \\sqrt{1-e^2}$ we have:\n\n$$~\na(1-e^2) = c^2/(GM) = (\\frac{2\\pi a b}{T})^2 \\frac{1}{GM} =\n\\frac{(2\\pi)^2}{GM} \\frac{a^2 (a^2(1-e^2))}{T^2},\n~$$\n\nor after cancelling $(1-e^2)$ from each side:\n\n$$~\nT^2 = \\frac{(2\\pi)^2}{GM} \\frac{a^4}{a} = \\frac{(2\\pi)^2}{GM} a^3.\n~$$\n\n\n----\n\nThe above shows how Newton might have derived Kepler's observational facts. Next we show, that assuming the laws of Kepler can anticipate Newton's equation for gravitational force. This follows [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_laws_of_planetary_motion#Planetary_acceleration).\n\nNow let $\\vec{r}(t)$ be the position of the planet relative to the Sun at the origin, in two dimensions (we used $\\vec{x}(t)$ above). Assume $\\vec{r}(0)$ points in the $x$ direction.\nWrite $\\vec{r} = r \\hat{r}$. Define $\\hat{\\theta(t)}$ to be the mapping from time $t$ to the angle  defined by $\\hat{r}$ through the unit circle.\n\nThen we express the velocity ($\\dot{\\vec{r}}$) and acceleration ($\\ddot{\\vec{r}}$) in terms of the orthogonal vectors $\\hat{r}$ and $\\hat{\\theta}$, as follows:\n\n$$~\n\\frac{d}{dt}(r \\hat{r}) = \\dot{r} \\hat{r} + r \\dot{\\hat{r}} =  \\dot{r} \\hat{r} + r \\dot{\\theta}\\hat{\\theta}.\n~$$\n\nThe last equality from expressing $\\hat{r}(t) = \\hat{r}(\\theta(t))$ and using the chain rule, noting $d(\\hat{r}(\\theta))/d\\theta = \\hat{\\theta}$.\n\nContinuing,\n\n$$~\n\\frac{d^2}{dt^2}(r \\hat{r}) =\n(\\ddot{r} \\hat{r} + \\dot{r} \\dot{\\hat{r}}) +\n(\\dot{r} \\dot{\\theta}\\hat{\\theta} + r \\ddot{\\theta}\\hat{\\theta} + r \\dot{\\theta}\\dot{\\hat{\\theta}}).\n~$$\n\nNoting, similar to above, $\\dot{\\hat{\\theta}}  = d\\hat{\\theta}/dt = d\\hat{\\theta}/d\\theta \\cdot d\\theta/dt = -\\dot{\\theta} \\hat{r}$ we can express the above in terms of $\\hat{r}$ and $\\hat{\\theta}$ as:\n\n$$~\n\\vec{a} = \\frac{d^2}{dt^2}(r \\hat{r}) = (\\ddot{r} - r (\\dot{\\theta})^2) \\hat{r}  + (r\\ddot{\\theta}  + 2\\dot{r}\\dot{\\theta}) \\hat{\\theta}.\n~$$\n\nThat is, in general, the acceleration has a radial component and a transversal component.\n\nKepler's second law says that the area increment over time is constant ($dA/dt$), but this area increment is approximated by the following wedge in polar coordinates: $dA = (1/2) r \\cdot rd\\theta$. We have then $dA/dt = r^2 \\dot{\\theta}$ is constant.\n\nDifferentiating, we have:\n\n$$~\n0 = \\frac{d(r^2 \\dot{\\theta})}{dt} = 2r\\dot{r}\\dot{\\theta} + r^2 \\ddot{\\theta},\n~$$\n\nwhich is the tranversal component of the acceleration times $r$, as decomposed above. This means, that the acceleration of the planet is completely towards the Sun at the origin.\n\nKepler's first law, relates $r$ and $\\theta$ through the polar equation of an ellipse:\n\n$$~\nr = \\frac{p}{1 + \\epsilon \\cos(\\theta)}.\n~$$\n\nExpressing in terms of $p/r$ and differentiating in $t$ gives:\n\n$$~\n-\\frac{p \\dot{r}}{r^2} = -\\epsilon\\sin(\\theta) \\dot{\\theta}.\n~$$\n\nOr\n\n$$~\np\\dot{r} = \\epsilon\\sin(\\theta) r^2 \\dot{\\theta} = \\epsilon \\sin(\\theta) C,\n~$$\n\nFor a constant $C$, used above, as the second laws implies $r^2 \\dot{\\theta}$ is constant. (This constant can be expressed in terms of parameters describing the ellipse.)\n\nDifferentiating again in $t$, gives:\n\n$$~\np \\ddot{r} = C\\epsilon \\cos(\\theta) \\dot{\\theta} = C\\epsilon \\cos(\\theta)\\frac{C}{r^2}.\n~$$\n\nSo $\\ddot{r} = (C^2 \\epsilon / p) \\cos{\\theta} (1/r^2)$.\n\nThe radial acceleration from above is:\n\n$$~\n\\ddot{r} - r (\\dot{\\theta})^2 =\n(C^2 \\epsilon/p) \\cos{\\theta} \\frac{1}{r^2} - r\\frac{C^2}{r^4} = \\frac{C^2}{pr^2}(\\epsilon \\cos(\\theta) - \\frac{p}{r}).\n~$$\n\nUsing $p/r = 1 + \\epsilon\\cos(\\theta)$, we have the radial acceleration is $C^2/p \\cdot (1/r^2)$. That is the acceleration, is proportional to the inverse square of the position, and using the relation between $F$, force, and acceleration, we see the force on the planet follows the inverse-square law of Newton.\n\n\n\n### Moving frames of reference\n\nIn the last example, it proved useful to represent vectors in terms of\nother unit vectors, in that case $\\hat{r}$ and $\\hat{\\theta}$. Here we\ndiscuss a coordinate system defined intrinsically by the motion along\nthe trajectory of a curve.\n\nLet $r(t)$ be a smooth vector-valued function in $R^3$. It gives rise to a space curve, through its graph. This curve has tangent vector $\\vec{r}'(t)$, indicating the direction of travel along $\\vec{r}$ as $t$ increases. The length of $\\vec{r}'(t)$ depends on the parameterization of $\\vec{r}$, as for any increasing, differentiable function $s(t)$, the composition $\\vec{r}(s(t))$ will have derivative, $\\vec{r}'(s(t)) s'(t)$, having the same direction as $\\vec{r}'(t)$ (at suitably calibrated points), but not the same magnitude, the factor of $s(t)$ being involved.\n\nTo discuss properties intrinsic to the curve, the unit vector is considered:\n\n$$~\n\\hat{T}(t) = \\frac{\\vec{r}'(t)}{\\|\\vec{r}'(t)\\|}.\n~$$\n\n\nThe function $\\hat{T}(t)$ is the unit tangent vector.\nNow define the unit *normal*, $\\hat{N}(t)$, by:\n\n$$~\n\\hat{N}(t) = \\frac{\\hat{T}'(t)}{\\| \\hat{T}'(t) \\|}.\n~$$\n\nSince $\\|\\hat{T}(t)\\| = 1$, a constant, it must be that $\\hat{T}'(t) \\cdot \\hat{T}(t) = 0$, that is, the $\\hat{N}$ and $\\hat{T}$ are orthogonal.\n\nFinally, define the *binormal*, $\\hat{B}(t) = \\hat{T}(t) \\times \\hat{N}(t)$. At each time $t$, the three unit vectors are orthogonal to each other. They form a moving coordinate system for the motion along the curve that does not depend on the parameterization.\n\nWe can visualize this, for example along a [Viviani](https://tinyurl.com/y4lo29mv) curve, as is done in a [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frenet%E2%80%93Serret_formulas) animation:"

        "Levi and Tabachnikov prove in their Proposition 2.4:\n\n$$~\n\\begin{align}\n\\kappa(u) &= \\frac{d\\alpha(u)}{du} + \\frac{\\sin(\\alpha(u))}{a},\\\\\n|\\frac{du}{dv}| &= |\\cos(\\alpha)|, \\quad \\text{and}\\\\\nk &= \\frac{\\tan(\\alpha)}{a}.\n\\end{align}\n~$$\n\nThe first equation relates the steering angle with the curvature. If the steering angle is not changed ($d\\alpha/du=0$) then the curvature is constant and the motion is circular. It will be greater for larger angles (up to $\\pi/2$). As the curvature is the reciprocal of the radius, this means the radius of the circular trajectory will be smaller. For the same constant steering angle, the curvature will be smaller for longer wheelbases, meaning the circular trajectory will have a larger radius. For cars, which have similar dynamics, this means longer wheelbase cars will take more room to make a U turn.\n\nThe second equation may be interpreted in ratio of arc lengths. The infinitesimal arc length of the rear wheel is proportional to that of the front wheel only scaled down by $\\cos(\\alpha)$. When $\\alpha=0$ - the bike is moving in a straight line - and the two are the same. At the other extreme - when $\\alpha=\\pi/2$ - the bike must be pivoting on its rear wheel and the rear wheel has no arc length. This cosine, is related to the speed of the back wheel relative to the speed of the front wheel, which was used in the initial differential equation.\n\nThe last equation, relates the curvature of the back wheel track to the steering angle of the front wheel. When $\\alpha=\\pm\\pi/2$, the rear-wheel curvature, $k$, is infinite, resulting in a cusp (no circle with non-zero radius will approximate the trajectory). This occurs when the front wheel is steered orthogonal to the direction of motion. As was seen in previous graphs of the trajectories, a cusp can happen for quite regular front wheel trajectories.\n\n\nTo derive the first one, we have previously noted that\nwhen a curve is parameterized by arc length, the curvature is more directly computed: it is the magnitude of the derivative of the tangent vector.\nThe tangent vector is of unit length, when parametrized by arc length. This implies it's derivative will be orthogonal. If $\\vec{r}(t)$ is a parameterization by arc length, then the curvature formula simplifies as:\n\n$$~\n\\kappa(s) = \\frac{\\| \\vec{r}'(s) \\times \\vec{r}''(s) \\|}{\\|\\vec{r}'(s)\\|^3} =\n\\frac{\\| \\vec{r}'(s) \\times \\vec{r}''(s) \\|}{1} =\n\\| \\vec{r}'(s) \\| \\| \\vec{r}''(s) \\| \\sin(\\theta) =\n1 \\| \\vec{r}''(s) \\| 1 = \\| \\vec{r}''(s) \\|.\n~$$\n\n\nSo in the above, the curvature is $\\kappa = \\| \\vec{F}''(u) \\|$ and $k = \\|\\vec{B}''(v)\\|$.\n\nOn the figure, the tangent vector $\\vec{F}'(u)$ is drawn, along with this unit vector rotated by $\\pi/2$. We call these, for convenience, $\\vec{U}$ and $\\vec{V}$. We have $\\vec{U} = \\vec{F}'(u)$ and $\\vec{V} = -(1/\\kappa) \\vec{F}''(u)$.\n\n\nThe key decomposition, is to express a unit vector in the direction of the line segment, as the vector $\\vec{U}$ rotated by $\\alpha$ degrees. Mathematically, this is usually expressed in matrix notation, but more explicitly by\n\n$$~\n\\langle \\cos(\\alpha) \\vec{U}_1 - \\sin(\\alpha) \\vec{U}_2,\n\\sin(\\alpha) \\vec{U}_1 + \\cos(\\alpha) \\vec{U}_2 =\n\\vec{U} \\cos(\\alpha) - \\vec{V} \\sin(\\alpha).\n~$$\n\nWith this, the mathematical relationship between $F$ and $B$ is just a multiple of this unit vector:\n\n$$~\n\\vec{B}(u) = \\vec{F}(u) - a \\vec{U} \\cos(\\alpha) + a \\vec{V} \\sin(\\alpha).\n~$$\n\nIt must be that the tangent line of $\\vec{B}$ is parallel to $\\vec{U} \\cos(\\alpha) + \\vec{V} \\sin(\\alpha)$. To utilize this, we differentiate $\\vec{B}$ using the facts that $\\vec{U}' = \\kappa \\vec{V}$ and $\\vec{V}' = -\\kappa \\vec{U}$. These coming from $\\vec{U} = \\vec{F}'$ and so it's derivative in $u$ has magnitude yielding the curvature, $\\kappa$, and direction orthogonal to $\\vec{U}$.\n\n$$~\n\\begin{align}\n\\vec{B}'(u) &= \\vec{F}'(u)\n-a \\vec{U}' \\cos(\\alpha) -a \\vec{U} (-\\sin(\\alpha)) \\alpha'\n+a \\vec{V}' \\sin(\\alpha) + a \\vec{V} \\cos(\\alpha) \\alpha'\\\\\n& =  \\vec{U}\n-a (\\kappa) \\vec{V} \\cos(\\alpha) + a \\vec{U} \\sin(\\alpha) \\alpha' +\na (-\\kappa) \\vec{U} \\sin(\\alpha) + a \\vec{V} \\cos(\\alpha) \\alpha' \\\\\n&= \\vec{U}\n+ a(\\alpha' - \\kappa) \\sin(\\alpha) \\vec{U}\n+ a(\\alpha' - \\kappa) \\cos(\\alpha)\\vec{V}.\n\\end{align}\n~$$\n\nExtend the 2-dimensional vectors to 3-d, by adding a zero $z$ component, then:\n\n$$~\n\\begin{align}\n\\vec{0} &= (\\vec{U}\n+ a(\\alpha' - \\kappa) \\sin(\\alpha) \\vec{U}\n+ a(\\alpha' - \\kappa) \\cos(\\alpha)\\vec{V}) \\times\n(-\\vec{U} \\cos(\\alpha) +  \\vec{V} \\sin(\\alpha)) \\\\\n&= (\\vec{U} \\times \\vec{V}) \\sin(\\alpha) +\na(\\alpha' - \\kappa) \\sin(\\alpha) \\vec{U} \\times  \\vec{V} \\sin(\\alpha)) -\na(\\alpha' - \\kappa) \\cos(\\alpha)\\vec{V} \\times \\vec{U} \\cos(\\alpha) \\\\\n&= (\\sin(\\alpha) + a(\\alpha'-\\kappa) \\sin^2(\\alpha) +\na(\\alpha'-\\kappa) \\cos^2(\\alpha)) \\vec{U} \\times \\vec{V} \\\\\n&= (\\sin(\\alpha) + a (\\alpha' - \\kappa)) \\vec{U} \\times \\vec{V}.\n\\end{align}\n~$$\n\nThe terms $\\vec{U} \\times\\vec{U}$ and $\\vec{V}\\times\\vec{V}$ being $\\vec{0}$, due to properties of the cross product.
