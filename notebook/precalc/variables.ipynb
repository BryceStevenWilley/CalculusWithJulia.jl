        "The Google calculator has a button `Ans` to refer to the answer to the\nprevious evaluation. This is a form of memory. The last answer is\nstored in a specific place in memory for retrieval when `Ans` is\nused. In some calculators, more advanced memory features are\npossible. For some, it is possible to push values onto a stack of\nvalues for them to be referred to at a later time. This proves useful\nfor complicated expressions, say, as the expression can be broken into\nsmaller intermediate steps to be computed. These values can then be\nappropriately combined. This strategy is a good one, though the memory\nbuttons can make its implementation a bit cumbersome.\n\nWith `Julia`, as with other programming languages, it is very easy to\nrefer to past evaluations. This is done by *assignment* whereby a\ncomputed value stored in memory is associated with a name. The name\ncan be used to look up the value later.\n\nAssignment in `Julia` is handled by the equals sign and takes the general form `variable_name = value`.
