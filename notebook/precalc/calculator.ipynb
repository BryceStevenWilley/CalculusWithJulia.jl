        "## Order of operations\n\nThe calculator must use some rules to define how it will evaluate its instructions when two or more operations are involved. We know mathematically, that when $1 + 2 \\cdot 3$ is to be evaluated the multiplication is  done first then the addition.\n\nWith the Google Calculator, typing `1 + 2 x 3 =` will give the value\n$7$, but *if* we evaluate the `+` sign first, via `1`  `+` `2` `=` `x` `3` `=` the\nanswer will be 9, as that will force the addition of `1+2` before\nmultiplying. The more traditional way of performing that calculation\nis to use *parentheses* to force an evaluation. That is,\n`(1 + 2) * 3 =` will produce `9` (though one must type it in, and not use a mouse\nto enter). Except for the most primitive of calculators, there are\ndedicated buttons for parentheses to group expressions.\n\nIn `Julia`, the entire expression is typed in before being evaluated,\nso the usual conventions of mathematics related to the order of\noperations may be used. These are colloquially summarized by the\nacronym [PEMDAS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations).\n\n> **PEMDAS**. This acronym stands for Parentheses, Exponents,\n> Multiplication, Division, Addition, Subtraction. The order indicates\n> which operation has higher precedence, or should happen first. This\n> isn't exactly the case, as \"M\" and \"D\" have the same precedence, as\n> do \"A\" and \"S\". In the case of two operations with equal precedence,\n> *associativity* is used to decide which to do. For the operations\n> `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` the associativity is left to right, as in the\n> left one is done first, then the right. However, `^` has right\n> associativity, so `4^3^2` is `4^(3^2)` and not `(4^3)^2`. (Be warned\n> that some calculators - and spread sheets, such as Excel - will\n> treat this expression with left associativity.)\n\n\nWith rules of precedence, an expression like the following has a\nclear interpretation to `Julia` without the need for parentheses:"

It can be best to be explicit about multiplication, save for the simplest of cases.\n\n\n## Functions\n\nOn the Google calculator, the square root button has a single purpose: for the current value find a square root if possible, and if not signal an error (such as what happens if the value is negative). For more general powers, the $x^y$ key can be used.\n\nIn `Julia`, functions are used to perform the actions that a\nspecialized button may do on the calculator. `Julia` provides many\nstandard mathematical functions - more than there could be buttons on\na calculator - and allows the user to easily define their own\nfunctions. For example, `Julia` provides the same set of functions as on\nGoogle's calculator, though with different names. For logarithms,\n$\\ln$ becomes `log` and $\\log$ is `log10` (computer programs almost\nexclusively reserve `log` for the natural log); for factorials, $x!$,\nthere is `factorial`; for powers $\\sqrt{}$ becomes `sqrt`, $EXP$\nbecomes `exp`, and $x^y$ is computed with the infix operator `^`. For the trigonometric\nfunctions, the basic names are similar: `sin`, `cos`, `tan`. These\nexpect radians. For angles in degrees, the convenience functions\n`sind`, `cosd`, and `tand` are provided. On the calculator, inverse\nfunctions like $\\sin^{-1}(x)$ are done by combining $Inv$ with\n$\\sin$. With `Julia`, the function name is `asin`, an abbreviation for\n\"arcsine.\" (Which is a good thing, as the notation using a power of\n$-1$ is often a source of confusion and is not supported by `Julia`.) Similarly, there\nare `asind`, `acos`, `acosd`, `atan`, and `atand` functions available\nto the `Julia` user.\n\nThe following table summarizes the above:"

Polymorphism is also commonly referred to as *multiple\n// dispatch*. This is a great convenience for the user who only needs to\n// remember one function name for related uses, that may differ only in\n// technicalities.  For example, there are about $200$ methods\n// implemented for the generic function `+`.
