        "For the motion in the above figure, the object's $x$ and $y$ values change according to the same rule, but, as the acceleration is different in each direction, we get different formula, namely: $x(t) = x_0 + v_{0x} t$ and $y(t) = y_0 + v_{0y}t - 1/2 \\cdot gt^2$.\n\nIt is common to work with *both* formulas at once. Mathematically,\nwhen graphing, we naturally pair off two values using Cartesian\ncoordinates (e.g., $(x,y)$). Another means of combining related values\nis to use a *vector*. The notation for a vector varies, but to\ndistinguish them from a point we will use $\\langle x,~ y\\rangle$.\nWith this notation, we can use it to represent the position,\nthe velocity, and the acceleration at time $t$ through:\n\n$$~\n\\begin{align}\n\\vec{x} &= \\langle x_0 + v_{0x}t,~ -(1/2) g t^2 + v_{0y}t  + y_0 \\rangle,\\\\\n\\vec{v} &= \\langle v_{0x},~ -gt + v_{0y} \\rangle, \\text{ and }\\\\\n\\vec{a} &= \\langle 0,~ -g \\rangle.\n\\end{align}\n~$$\n\n\n\nDon't spend time thinking about the formulas if they are\nunfamiliar. The point emphasized here is that we have used the\nnotation $\\langle x,~ y \\rangle$ to collect the two values into a\nsingle object, which we indicate through a label on the variable\nname. These are vectors, and we shall see they find use far beyond\nthis application.\n\nInitially, our primary use of vectors will be as containers, but it is\nworthwhile to spend some time to discuss properties of vectors and\ntheir visualization.\n\n\nA line segment in the plane connects two points $(x_0, y_0)$ and\n$(x_1, y_1)$. The length of a line segment (its magnitude) is given by\nthe distance formula $\\sqrt{(x_1 - x_0)^2 + (y_1 - y_0)^2}$.  A line\nsegment can be given a direction by assigning an initial point and a\nterminal point. A directed line segment has both a direction and a\nmagnitude. A vector is an abstraction where just these two properties\n- a direction and a magnitude - are intrinsic. While a directed line\nsegment can be represented by a vector, a single vector describes all\nsuch line segments found by translation. That is, how the the vector\nis located when visualized is for convenience, it is not a characteristic of\nthe vector. In the figure above, all vectors are drawn with their tails\nat the position of the projectile over time.\n\n\n\nWe can visualize a (two-dimensional) vector as an arrow in space. This arrow\nhas two components. We represent a vector\nthan mathematically as $\\langle x,~ y \\rangle$. For example, the vector\nconnecting the point $(x_0, y_0)$ to $(x_1, y_1)$ is $\\langle x_1 -\nx_0,~ y_1 - y_0 \\rangle$.\n\nThe magnitude of a vector comes from the distance formula applied to a line segment, and is\n$\\| \\vec{v} \\| = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$."

        "These two functions modify or mutate the values stored within the\nvector `v` that passed as an argument. In the `push!` example above,\nthe value `5` is added to the vector of 4 elements. In `Julia`, a\nconvention is to name mutating functions with a trailing exclamation\nmark. (Again, these do not mutate the binding of `v` to the container,\nbut do mutate the contents of the container.) There are functions with\nmutating and non-mutating definitions, an example is `sort` and\n`sort!`.\n\nIf only a mutating function is available, like `push!`, and this is\nnot desired a copy of the vector can be made. It is not enough to copy\nby assignment, as with `w = v`. As both `w` and `v` will be bound to\nthe same memory location. Rather, you call `copy` to make a new\ncontainer with copied contents, as in `w = copy(v)`.\n\nCreating new vectors of a given size is common for programming, though\nnot much use will be made here. There are many different functions to\ndo so: `ones` to make a vector of ones, `zeros` to make a vector of\nzeros, `trues` and `falses` to make Boolean vectors of a given size,\nand `similar` to make a similar-sized vector (with no particular\nvalues assigned).\n\n\n## Applying functions element by element to values in a vector\n\nFunctions such as `sum` or `length` are known as *reductions* as they reduce the \"dimensionality\" of the data: a vector is in some sense $1$-dimensional, the sum or length $0$-dimensional.  Applying a reduction is straightforward, it is just a regular function call.\n\nOther desired operations with vectors act differently. Rather than reduce a collection of values using some formula, the goal is to apply some formula to *each* of the values, returning a modified vector. A simple example might be to square each element, or subtract the average value from each element. An example comes from statistics. When computing a variance, we start with data $x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n$ and along the way form the values $(x_1-\\bar{x})^2, (x_2-\\bar{x})^2, \\dots, (x_n-\\bar{x})^2$.\n\nSuch things can be done in *many* differents ways. Here we describe two, but will primarily utilize the first.\n\n### Broadcasting a function call\n\nIf we have a vector, `xs`, and a function, `f`, to apply to each value, there is a simple means to achieve this task. By adding a \"dot\" between the function name and the parenthesis that enclose the arguments, instructs `Julia` to \"broadcast\" the function call. The details allow for more flexibility, for this purpose, broadcasting will take each value in `xs` and apply `f` to it, returning a vector of the same size as `xs`. When more than one argument is involved, broadcasting will try to fill out different sized objects.\n\n\n\nFor example, the following will find,  using `sqrt`, the square root each value in a vector:"

If a vector if formed by placing comma-separated values within a `[]` pair (e.g., `[1,2,3]`), a tuple is formed by placing comma-separated values withing a `()` pair. I tuple of length $1$ uses a convention of a trailing comma to distinguish it from a parethesized expression (e.g. `(1,)` is a tuple, `(1)` is just the value `1`).\n\nTuples are used in programming, as they don't typically require memory to be used so they can be faster. Internal usages are for function arguments and function return types. Unlike vectors, tuples can be heterogeneous collections. (When commas are used to combine more than one output into a cell, a tuple is being used.)\n\nAlso unlike vectors, tuples can have names which can be used for referening a value, similar to indexing but possibly more convenient.\nNamed tuples as similar to *dictionaries* which are used to associate a key (like a name) with a value.\n\n## Questions\n\n###### Question\n\nWhich command will create the vector $\\vec{v} = \\langle 4,~ 3 \\rangle$?"
