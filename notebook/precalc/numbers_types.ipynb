These model the real numbers. `Julia`, on other other hand, has\na rich type system, and within that has many different number\ntypes. There are types that model each of the four main systems above,\nand within each type, specializations for how these values are stored.\n\nMost of the details will not be of interest to all, and will be described later.\n\n\nFor now, let's consider the number 1.

        "## Some more details.\n\n\nWhat follows is only needed for those seeking more background.\n\n\nJulia has *abstract* number types `Integer`, `Real`, and `Number`. All\nfour types described above are of type `Number`, but `Complex` is not\nof type `Real`.\n\nHowever, a specific value is an instance of a *concrete* type. A\nconcrete type will also include information about how the value is\nstored. For example, the *integer* `1` could be stored using $64$ bits\nas a signed integers, or, should storage be a concern, as an $8$ bits\nsigned or even unsigned integer, etc.. If storage\nisn't an issue, but exactness at all scales is, then it can be stored in a manner\nthat allows for the storage to grow using \"big\" numbers.\n\nThese distinctions can be seen in how `Julia` parses these three values:\n\n* `1234567890` will be a $64$-bit integer (on newer machines), `Int64`\n* `12345678901234567890` will be a $128$ bit integer, `Int128`\n* `1234567890123456789012345678901234567890` will be a big integer, `BigInt`\n\nHaving abstract types allows programmers to write functions that will\nwork over a wide range of input values that are similar, but have\ndifferent implementation details.\n\n\n### Integers\n\nIntegers are often used casually, as they come about from parsing. As with a calculator, floating point numbers *could* be used for integers, but in `Julia` - and other languages - it proves useful to have numbers known to have *exact* values. In `Julia` there are built-in number types for integers stored in $8$, $16$, $32$, $64$, and $128$ bits and `BigInt`s if the previous aren't large enough. ($8$ bits can hold $8$ binary values representing $1$ of $256=2^8$ possibilities, whereas the larger $128$ bit can hold one of $2^{128}$ possibilities.) Smaller values can be more efficiently used, and this is leveraged at the system level, but not a necessary distinction with calculus where the default size along with an occasional usage of `BigInt` suffice.\n\n### Floating point numbers\n\n[Floating point](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_point) numbers\nare a computational model for the real numbers.  For floating point\nnumbers, $64$ bits are used by default for both $32$- and $64$-bit systems, though other storage sizes can be requested. This gives\na large - but still finite - set of real numbers that can be\nrepresented. However, there are infinitely many real numbers just\nbetween $0$ and $1$, so there is no chance that all can be represented\nexactly on the computer with a floating point value. Floating point\nthen is *necessarily* an approximation for all but a subset of the\nreal numbers. Floating point values can be viewed in normalized\n[scientific notation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_notation)\nas $a\\cdot 2^b$ where $a$ is the *significand* and $b$ is the\n*exponent*. Save for special values, the significand $a$ is normalized to satisfy $1 \\leq \\lvert a\\rvert <\n2$, the exponent can be taken to be an integer, possibly negative.\n\nAs per IEEE Standard 754, the `Float64` type gives 52 bits to the precision (with an additional implied one), 11 bits to the exponent and the other bit is used to represent the sign.  Positive, finite, floating point numbers have a range approximately between $10^{-308}$ and $10^{308}$, as 308 is about $\\log_{10}\\cdot 2^{1023}$. The numbers are not evenly spread out over this range, but, rather, are much more concentrated closer to $0$."

        "When learning calculus, the only common usage of complex numbers arises when solving polynomial equations for roots, or zeros, though they are very important for subsequent work using the concepts of calculus.\n\n\n## Type stability\n\nOne design priority of `Julia` is that it should be fast. How can\n`Julia` do this? In a simple model, `Julia` is an interface between\nthe user and the computer's processor(s). Processors consume a set of\ninstructions, the user issues a set of commands. `Julia` is in charge\nof the translation between the two. Ultimately `Julia` calls a compiler to create\nthe instructions. A basic premise is the shorter the instructions, the\nfaster they are to process. Shorter instructions can come about by\nbeing more explicit about what types of values the instructions\nconcern. Explicitness means, there is no need to reason about what a\nvalue can be. When `Julia` can reason about the type of value involved\nwithout having to reason about the values themselves, it can work with\nthe compiler to produce shorter lists of instructions.\n\nSo knowing the type of the output of a function can be a big\nadvantage. In `Julia` this is known as *type stability*. In the\nstandard `Julia` library, this is a primary design consideration.\n\n\n##### Example: closure\n\nTo motivate this a bit, we discuss how mathematics can be shaped by a\ndesire to stick to simple ideas.  A desirable algebraic property of a\nset of numbers and an operation - *closure*.  That is, if one takes an\noperation like `+` and then uses it to add two numbers in a set, will\nthat result also be in the set? If this is so for any pair of numbers,\nthen the set is closed with respect to the operation addition.\n\nLets suppose we start with the *natural numbers*: $1,2, \\dots$. Natural, in that we can easily represent small values in terms of fingers.\nThis set is closed under addition - as a child learns when counting using their fingers. However, if we started with the odd natural numbers, this set would *not* be closed under addition - $3+3=6$.\n\nThe natural numbers are not all the numbers we need, as once a desire\nfor subtraction is included, we find the set isn't closed. There isn't\na $0$, needed as $n-n=0$ and there aren't negative numbers. The set of\nintegers are needed for closure under addition and subtraction.\n\nThe integers are also closed under multiplication, which for integer values can be seen as just regrouping into longer additions.\n\nHowever, the integers are not closed under division - even if you put\naside the pesky issue of dividing by $0$. For that, the rational\nnumbers must be introduced. So aside from division by $0$, the rationals are closed under addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. There is one more fundamental operation though, powers.\n\nPowers are defined for positive integers in a simple enough manner\n\n$$~\na^n=a\\cdot a \\cdot a \\cdots a \\text{ (n times); }  a, n \\text{ are integers, $n$ is positive}.\n~$$\n\nWe can define $a^0$ to be $1$, except for the special case of $0^0$,\nwhich is left undefined mathematically (though it is also defined as\n`1` within `Julia`). We can extend the above to include negative\nvalues of $a$, but what about negative values of $n$? We can't say the\nintegers are closed under powers, as the definition consistent with\nthe rules that $a^{(-n)} = 1/a^n$ requires rational numbers to be\ndefined.\n\nWell, in the above `a` could be a rational number, is `a^n` closed for\nrational numbers? No again. Though it is fine for $n$ as an integer\n(save the odd case of $0$, simple definitions like $2^{1/2}$ are not\nanswered within the rationals. For this, we need to introduce the\n*real* numbers. It is mentioned that\n[Aristotle](http://tinyurl.com/bpqbkap) hinted at the irrationality of\nthe square root of $2$. To define terms like $a^{1/n}$ for integer\nvalues $a,n > 0$ a reference to a solution to an equation $x^n-a$ is\nused. Such solutions require the irrational numbers to have solutions\nin general. Hence the need for the real numbers (well, algebraic\nnumbers at least, though once the exponent is no longer a rational\nnumber, the full set of real numbers are needed.)\n\nSo, save the pesky cases, the real numbers will be closed under\naddition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and powers - provided\nthe base is non-negative.\n\nFinally for that last case, the complex numbers are introduced to give an answer to $\\sqrt{-1}$.\n\n\n\n----\n\n\nHow does this apply with `Julia`?\n\nThe point is, if we restrict our set of inputs, we can get more\nprecise values for the output of basic operations, but to get more\ngeneral inputs we need to have bigger output sets.\n\n\nA similar thing happens in `Julia`. For addition say, the addition of\ntwo integers of the same type will be an integer of that type. This\nspeed consideration is not solely for type stability, but also to\navoid checking for overflow.\n\nAnother example, the division of two integers will always be a number\nof the same type - floating point, as that is the only type that\nensures the answer will always fit within. (The explicit use of\nrationals notwithstanding.) So even if two integers are the input and\ntheir answer *could* be an integer, in `Julia` it will be a floating\npoint number, (cf. `2/1`).\n\nHopefully this helps explain the subtle issues around powers: in\n`Julia` an integer raised to an integer should be an integer, for\nspeed, though certain cases are special cased, like `2^(-1)`.  However\nsince a real number raised to a real number makes sense always when\nthe base is non-negative, as long as real numbers are used as outputs,\nthe expressions `2.0^(-1)` and `2^(-1.0)` are computed and real\nnumbers (floating points) are returned. For type stability, even\nthough $2.0^1$ could be an integer, a floating point answer is\nreturned.\n\nAs for negative bases, `Julia` could always return complex numbers,\nbut in addition to this being slower, it would be irksome to users. So\nuser's must opt in. Hence `sqrt(-1.0)` will be an error, but the more\nexplicit - but mathematically equivalent - `sqrt(-1.0 + 0im)` will not\nbe a domain error, but rather a complex value will be returned.\n\n\n\n## Questions\n\n###### Question\n\nThe number created by `pi/2` is?"
