        "A (univariate) mathematical function relates or associates values of\n$x$ to values $y$ using the notation $y=f(x)$. A key point is a given\n$x$ is associated with just one $y$ value, though a given $y$ value\nmay be associated with several different $x$ values.\n\nWe may conceptualize such a relation in many ways: through an algebraic\nrule; through the graph of $f$; through a description of what $f$\ndoes; or through a table of paired values, say.  For the moment, let's\nconsider a function as rule that takes in a value of $x$ and outputs a\nvalue $y$. If a rule is given defining the function, the computation\nof $y$ is straightforward. A different question is not so easy: for a\ngiven value $y$ what value - or *values* - of $x$ (if any) produce an output of\n$y$? That is, what $x$ value(s) satisfy $f(x)=y$?\n\n*If* for each $y$ in some set of values there is just one $x$ value, then this operation associates to each value $y$ a single value $x$, so it too is a function. When that is the case we call this an *inverse* function.\n\nWhy is this useful? When available, it can help us solve equations. If we can write our equation as $f(x) = y$, then we can \"solve\" for $x$ through $x = g(y)$, where $g$ is this inverse function.\n\nLet's explore when we can \"solve\" for an inverse function.\n\nConsider the graph of the function $f(x) = 2^x$:"

        "The graph of a function is a representation of points $(x,f(x))$, so\nto *find* $f(c)$ from the graph, we begin on the $x$ axis at $c$, move\nvertically to the graph (the point $(c, f(c))$), and then move\nhorizontally to the $y$ axis, intersecting it at $f(c)$. The figure\nshows this for $c=2$, from which we can read that $f(c)$ is about\n$4$. This is how an $x$ is associated to a single $y$.\n\nIf we were to *reverse* the direction, starting at $f(c)$ on the $y$\naxis and then moving horizontally to the graph, and then vertically to\nthe $x$-axis we end up at a value $c$ with the correct $f(c)$. This\noperation will form a function **if** the initial movement\nhorizontally is guaranteed to find *no more than one* value on the graph. That\nis, to have an inverse function, there can not be two $x$ values\ncorresponding to a given $y$ value. This observation is often\nvisualized through the \"horizontal line test\" - the graph of a function with an\ninverse function can only intersect a horizontal line at most in one\nplace.\n\n\nMore formally, a function is called *one-to-one* *if* for any two $a\n\\neq b$, it must be that $f(a) \\neq f(b)$. Many functions are\none-to-one, many are not. Familiar one-to-one functions are linear functions ($f(x)=a \\cdot x + b$ with $a\\neq 0$), odd powers of $x$ ($f(x)=x^{2k+1}$), and functions of the form $f(x)=x^{1/n}$ for $x \\geq 0$. In contrast, all *even* functions are *not* one-to-one, as $f(x) = f(-x)$ for any nonzero $x$ in the domain of $f$.\n\nA class of functions that are guaranteed to be one-to-one are the\n*strictly* increasing functions (which satisfy $a < b$ implies $f(a) <\nf(b)$). Similarly, strictly decreasing functions are one-to-one. The\nterm strictly *monotonic* is used to describe either strictly\nincreasing or strictly decreasing.  By the above observations,\nstrictly monotonic function will have inverse functions.\n\nThe function $2^x$, graphed above, is strictly increasing, so it will\nhave an inverse function. That is we can solve for $x$ in an equation\nlike $2^x = 9$ using the inverse function of $f(x) = 2^x$, provided we\ncan identify the inverse function.\n\n## How to solve for an inverse function?\n\nIf we know an inverse function exists, how can we find it?\n\nIf our function is given by a graph, the process above describes how to find the inverse function.\n\nHowever, typically we have a rule describing our function. What is the\nprocess then?  A simple example helps illustrate. The *linear*\nfunction $f(x) = 9/5\\cdot x + 32$ is strictly increasing, hence has an\ninverse function. What should it be? Let's describe the action of $f$:\nit multiplies $x$ by $9/5$ and then adds $32$. To \"invert\" this we\n*first* invert the adding of $32$ by subtracting $32$, then we would\n\"invert\" multiplying by $9/5$ by *dividing* by $9/5$. Hence $g(x)=(x-32)/(9/5)$.\nWe would generally simplify this, but let's not for now. If we\nview a function as a composition of many actions, then we find the\ninverse by composing the inverse of these actions in **reverse**\norder. The reverse order might seem confusing, but this is how we get\ndressed and undressed: to dress we put on socks and then shoes. To\nundress we take off the shoes and then take off the socks.\n\nWhen we solve algebraically for $x$ in $y=9/5 \\cdot x + 32$ we do the same thing as we do verbally: we subtract $32$ from each side, and then divide by $9/5$ to isolate $x$:\n\n$$~\n\\begin{align}\ny &= 9/5 \\cdot x + 32\\\\\ny - 32 &= 9/5 \\cdot x\\\\\n(y-32) / (9/5) &= x.\n\\end{align}\n~$$\n\nFrom this, we have the function $g(y) = (y-32) / (9/5)$ is the inverse function of $f(x) =  9/5\\cdot x + 32$.\n\n*Usually* univariate functions are written with $x$ as the dummy variable, so it is typical to write $g(x) = (x-32) / (9/5)$ as the inverse function.\n\n*Usually* we use the name $f^{-1}$ for the inverse function of $f$, so this would be most often [seen](http://tinyurl.com/qypbueb) as $f^{-1}(x) = (x-32)/(9/5)$ or after simplification $f^{-1}(x) = (5/9) \\cdot (x-32)$."

        "##### Example\n\nSuppose a transformation of $x$ is given by $y = f(x) = (ax + b)/(cx+d)$. This function is  invertible. Find the inverse and describe it's domain.\n\nFrom the expression $y=f(x)$ we *algebraically* solve for $x$:\n\n$$~\n\\begin{align*}\ny &= \\frac{ax +b}{cx+d}\\\\\ny \\cdot (cx + d) &= ax + b\\\\\nycx - ax &= b - yd\\\\\n(cy-a) \\cdot x &= b - dy\\\\\nx &= -\\frac{dy - b}{cy-a}.\n\\end{align*}\n~$$\n\nWe see that to solve for $x$ we need to divide by $cy-a$, so this expression can not be zero.\nSo, using $x$ as the dummy variable, we have\n\n$$~\nf^{-1}(x) = -\\frac{dx - b}{cx-a},\\quad  cx-a \\neq 0.\n~$$\n\n\n\n\n##### Example\n\nThe function $f(x) = (x-1)^5 + 2$ is strictly increasing and so will have an inverse function. Find it.\n\nAgain, we solve algebraically starting with $y=(x-1)^5 + 2$ and solving for $x$:\n\n$$~\n\\begin{align*}\ny &= (x-1)^5 + 2\\\\\ny - 2 &= (x-1)^5\\\\\n(y-2)^{1/5} &= x - 1\\\\\n(y-2)^{1/5} + 1 = x.\n\\end{align*}\n~$$\n\nWe see that $f^{-1}(x) = 1 + (x - 2)^{1/5}$. The fact that the power $5$ is an odd power is important, as this ensures a unique (real) solution to the fifth root of a value, in the above $y-2$.\n\n##### Example\n\nThe function $f(x) = x^x,  x \\geq 1/e$ is strictly\nincreasing. However, trying to algebraically solve for an inverse\nfunction will quickly run into problems (without using specially\ndefined functions). The existence of an inverse does not imply there\nwill always be luck in trying to find a mathematical rule defining the\ninverse.\n\n## Functions which are not always invertible\n\nConsider the function $f(x) = x^2$. The graph - a parabola - is clearly not *monotonic*. Hence no inverse function exists. Yet, we can solve equations $y=x^2$ quite easily: $y=\\sqrt{x}$ *or* $y=-\\sqrt{x}$. We know the square root undoes the squaring, but we need to be a little more careful to say the square root is the inverse of the squaring function.\n\nThe issue is there are generally *two* possible answers. To avoid this, we might choose to only take the *non-negative* answer. To make this all work as above, we restrict the domain of $f(x)$ and now consider the related function $f(x)=x^2, x \\geq 0$. This is now a monotonic function, so will have an inverse function. This is clearly $f^{-1}(x) = \\sqrt{x}$.\n\nThe [inverse function theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_function_theorem) basically says that if $f$ is *locally* monotonic, then an inverse function will exist *locally*. By \"local\" we mean in a neighborhood of $c$.\n\n##### Example\n\nConsider the function $f(x) = (1+x^2)^{-1}$. This bell-shaped function is even (symmetric about $0$), so can not possibly be one-to-one. However, if the domain is restricted to $[0,\\infty)$ it is. The restricted function is strictly decreasing and its inverse is found as follows:\n\n\n$$~\n\\begin{align*}\ny &= \\frac{1}{1 + x^2}\\\\\n1+x^2 &= \\frac{1}{y}\\\\\nx^2 &= \\frac{1}{y} - 1\\\\\nx &= \\sqrt{(1-y)/y}, \\quad 0 \\leq y \\leq 1.\n\\end{align*}\n~$$\n\nThen $f^{-1}(x) = \\sqrt{(1-x)/x}$ where $0 < x \\leq 1$. The somewhat\ncomplicated restriction for the the domain coincides with the range of\n$f(x)$. We shall see next that this is no coincidence.\n\n## Formal properties of the inverse function\n\nConsider again the graph of a monotonic function, in this case $f(x) = x^2 + 2, x \\geq 0$:"
