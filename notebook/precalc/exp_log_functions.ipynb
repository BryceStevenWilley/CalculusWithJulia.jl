        "The family of exponential functions is used to model growth and\ndecay. The family of logarithmic functions is defined here as the\ninverse of the exponential functions, but have reach far outside of that.\n\n\n## Exponential functions\n\nThe family of exponential functions is defined by\n$f(x) = a^x, -\\infty< x < \\infty$ and $a > 0$.\nFor $0 < a < 1$ these functions decay or decrease, for $a > 1$ the\nfunctions grow or increase, and if $a=1$ the function is constantly $1$.\n\nFor a given $a$, defining $a^n$ for positive integers is\nstraightforward, as it means multiplying $n$ copies of $a$. From this,\nthe key properties of exponents: $a^x \\cdot a^y = a^{x+y}$, and\n$(a^x)^y = a^{x \\cdot y}$ are immediate consequences. For $a \\neq 0$,\n$a^0$ is defined to be $1$. For positive, integer values of $n$, we\nhave $a^{-n} = 1/a^n$. For $n$ a positive integer, we can\ndefine $a^{1/n}$ to be the unique positive solution to $x^n=a$. And\nusing the key properties of exponents extend this to a definition of\n$a^x$ for any rational $x$.\n\nDefining $a^x$ for any real number requires some more sophisticated\nmathematics. One method is to use a\n[theorem](http://tinyurl.com/zk86c8r) that says a *bounded*\nmonotonically increasing sequence will converge. Then for $a > 1$ we\nhave if $q_n$ is a sequence of rational numbers increasing to $x$,\nthen $a^{q_n}$ will be a bounded sequence of increasing numbers, so\nwill converge to a number defined to be $a^x$. Something similar is\npossible for the $0 < a < 1$ case.\n\nThis definition can be done to ensure the rules of exponents hold for\n$a > 0$:\n\n$$~\na^{x + y} = a^x \\cdot a^y, \\quad (a^x)^y = a^{x \\cdot y}.\n~$$\n\n\nIn `Julia` these functions are implemented using `^` or for a base of\n$e$ through `exp(x)`.

        "That would be an enormous growth.  Don't worry: \"Exponential growth\ncannot continue indefinitely, however, because the medium is soon\ndepleted of nutrients and enriched with wastes.\"\n\n##### Example\n\nThe famous [Fibonacci](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number)\nnumbers are $1,1,2,3,5,8,13,\\dots$, where $F_{n+1}=F_n+F_{n-1}$. These numbers increase. To see how fast, if we *guess* that\nthe growth is evenually exponential and assume $F_n \\approx c \\cdot a^n$, then\nour equation is approximately $a^{n+1} = a^n + a^{n-1}$ which has solutions $a$\nsatisfying $a^2 - a -1 = 0$. The positve solution is\n$(1 + \\sqrt{5})/2\\approx 1.618$\n\nThat is evidence that the $F_n \\approx 1.618^n$. (See\n[Relation to golden ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number#Relation_to_the_golden_ratio)\nfor a related, but more explicit exact formula.\n\n##### Example\n\nIn the previous example, the exponential family of functions is used\nto describe growth. Polynomial functions also increase. Could these be\nused instead? If so that would be great, as they are easier to reason\nabout.\n\nThe key fact is that exponential growth is much greater than\npolynomial growth. That is for large enough $x$ and for any fixed\n$a>1$ and positive integer $n$ it is true that $a^x \\gg x^n$.\n\nLater we will see an easy way to certify this statement.\n\n\n\n## Logarithmic functions: the inverse of exponential functions\n\nAs the exponential functions are strictly *decreasing* when $0 < a <\n1$ and strictly *increasing* when $a>1$, in both cases an inverse\nfunction will exist. (When $a=1$ the function is a constant and is not\none-to-one.) The domain of an exponential function is all real $x$ and\nthe range is all *positive* $x$, so these are switched around for the\ninverse function.\n\nThe inverse function will solve for $x$ in the equation $a^x = y$. The\nanswer, formally, is the logarithm base $a$, written $\\log_a(x)$.\n\nThat is $a^{\\log_a(x)} = x$ and $\\log_a(a^x) = x$ when defined.\n\n\nTo see how a logarithm is mathematically defined will have to wait,\nthough the family of functions - one for each $a>0$ - are implemented in `Julia` through the function\n`log(a,x)`. There are special cases requiring just one argument: `log(x)` will compute the natural\nlog, base $e$ - the inverse of $f(x) = e^x$; `log2(x)` will compute the\nlog base $2$ - the inverse of $f(x) = 2^x$; and `log10(x)` will compute\nthe log base $10$ - the inverse of $f(x)=10^x$.\n\nTo see this in an example, we plot for base $2$ the exponential\nfunction $f(x)=2^x$, its inverse, and the logarithm function with base\n$2$:"

        "Now, what do the properties of exponents imply about logarithms?\n\nConsider the sum $\\log_a(u) + \\log_a(v)$. If we raise $a$ to this\npower, we have using the powers of exponents and the inverse nature of\n$a^x$ and $\\log_a(x)$ that:\n\n$$~\na^{\\log_a(u) + \\log_a(v)} = a^{\\log_a(u)} \\cdot a^{\\log_a(v)} = u \\cdot v.\n~$$\n\nTaking $\\log_a$ of *both* sides yields $\\log_a(u) + \\log_a(v)=\\log_a(u\\cdot v)$. That is logarithms turn products into sums (of logs).\n\nSimilarly, the relation $(a^{x})^y =a^{x \\cdot y}, a > 0$s can be used to see that\n$\\log_a(b^x) = x \\cdot\\log_a(b)$. This follows, as applying $a^x$ to each side yields the\nsame answer.\n\nDue to inverse relationship between $a^x$ and $\\log_a(x)$ we have:\n\n$$~\na^{\\log_a(b^x)} = b^x.\n~$$\n\nDue to the rules of exponents, we have:\n\n$$~\na^{x \\log_a(b)} = a^{\\log_a(b) \\cdot x} = (a^{\\log_a(b)})^x = b^x.\n~$$\n\nFinally, since $a^x$ is one-to-one (when $a>0$ and $a \\neq 1$), if  $a^{\\log_a(b^x)}=a^{x \\log_a(b)}$ it must be that $\\log_a(b^x) = x \\log_a(b)$. That is, logarithms turn powers into products.\n\nFinally, we use the inverse property of logarithms and powers to show that logarithms can be defined for any base. Say $a, b > 0$. Then $\\log_a(x) = \\log_b(x)/\\log_b(a)$. Again, to verify this we apply $a^x$ to both sides to see we get the same answer:\n\n$$~\na^{\\log_a(x)} = x,\n~$$\n\nthis by the inverse property. Whereas, by expressing $a=b^{\\log_b(a)}$ we have:\n\n$$~\na^{(\\log_b(x)/\\log_b(b))} = (b^{\\log_b(a)})^{(\\log_b(x)/\\log_b(a))} =\nb^{\\log_b(a) \\cdot \\log_b(x)/\\log_b(a) } = b^{\\log_b(x)} = x.\n~$$\n\nIn short we have these three properties of logarithmic functions:\n\n> if $a,b$ are positive bases; $u,v$ are positive numbers; and $x$ is any real number then: 1) $\\log_a(uv) = \\log_a(u) + \\log_a(v)$, 2) $\\log_a(u^x) = x \\log_a(u)$, and  3) $\\log_a(u) = \\log_b(u)/\\log_b(a)$.\n\n##### Example\n\nBefore the ubiquity of electonic calculating devices, the need to\ncompute was still present. Ancient civilizations had abacuses to make\naddition easier. For multiplication and powers a [slide\nrule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slide_rule) rule could be used.\nIt is easy to represent addition physically with two straight pieces\nof wood - just represent a number with a distance and align the two\npieces so that the distances are sequentially arranged. To multiply\nthen was as easy: represent the logarithm of a number with a distance\nthen add the logarithms. The sum of the logarithms is the logarithm of\nthe *product* of the original two values. Converting back to a number\nanswers the question. The conversion back and forth is done by simply\nlabeling the wood using a logartithmic scale. The slide rule was\n[invented](http://tinyurl.com/qytxo3e) soon after Napier's initial publication\non the logarithm in 1614.\n\n\n##### Example\n\nReturning to the Rule of 72, what should the exact number be?\n\nThe amount of time to double an investment that grows according to\n$P_0 e^{rt}$ solves $P_0 e^{rt} = 2P_0$ or $rt = \\log_2(2)$.
