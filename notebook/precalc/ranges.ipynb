Checking for divisibility by\nseven is unusual enough there is nothing built in for that, but\nchecking for division by $2$ is common, and for that, there is a\nbuilt-in function `iseven`.\n\nThe act of throwing out elements of a collection based on some\ncondition is called *filtering*. The `filter` function does this in\n`Julia`; the basic syntax being\n`filter(predicate_function, collection)`.\nThe \"`predicate_function`\" is one that returns either\n`true` or `false`, such as `iseven`.

        "#### Example\n\nThis example of Stefan Karpinski comes from a\n[blog](http://julialang.org/blog/2016/10/julia-0.5-highlights) post\nhighlighting changes to the `Julia` language with version\n`v\"0.5.0\"`, which added features to comprehensions that made this example possible. It involves making change. First, a simple question: using\npennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters how many different ways can we\ngenerate one dollar? Clearly $100$ pennies, or $20$ nickels, or $10$ dimes,\nor $4$ quarters will do this, so the answer is at least four, but how\nmuch more than four?\n\nWell, we can use a comprehension to enumerate the\npossibilities. This example illustrates how comprehensions and generators can involve one or more variable for the iteration.\n\n\n\nFirst, we either have $0,1,2,3$, or $4$ quarters, or $0$, $25$\ncents, $50$ cents, $75$ cents, or a dollar's worth. If we have, say, $1$\nquarter, then we need to make up $75$ cents with the rest. If we had $3$\ndimes, then we need to make up $45$ cents out of nickels and pennies,\nif we then had $6$ nickels, we know we must need $15$ pennies.\n\n\nThe following expression shows how counting this can be done through\nenumeration. Here `q` is the amount contributed by quarters, `d` the\namount from dimes, `n` the amount from nickels, and `p` the amount from\npennies. `q` ranges over $0, 25, 50, 75, 100$ or `0:25:100`, etc. If\nwe know that the sum of quarters, dimes, nickels contributes a certain\namount, then the number of pennies must round things up to $100$."
