        "### The trigonometric functions in Julia\n\nJulia has the 6 basic trigonometric functions defined through the functions `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `csc`, `sec`, and `cot`.\n\nTwo right triangles - the one with equal, $\\pi/4$, angles; and the\none with angles $\\pi/6$ and $\\pi/3$ can have the ratio of their sides\ncomputed from basic geometry. In particular, this leads to the following values, which are\nusually committed to memory:\n\n$$~\n\\begin{align}\n\\sin(0) &= 0, \\quad \\sin(\\pi/6) = \\frac{1}{2}, \\quad \\sin(\\pi/4) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}, \\quad\\sin(\\pi/3) = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2},\\text{ and } \\sin(\\pi/2) = 1\\\\\n\\cos(0) &= 1, \\quad \\cos(\\pi/6) =  \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}, \\quad \\cos(\\pi/4) = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}, \\quad\\cos(\\pi/3) = \\frac{1}{2},\\text{ and } \\cos(\\pi/2) = 0.\n\\end{align}\n~$$\n\nUsing the circle definition allows these basic values to inform us of\nvalues throughout the unit circle.\n\n\nThese all follow from the definition involving the unit circle:\n\n\n* If the angle $\\theta$ corresponds to a point $(x,y)$ on the unit circle, then the angle $-\\theta$ corresponds to $(x, -y)$. So $\\sin(\\theta) = - \\sin(-\\theta)$ (an odd function), but $\\cos(\\theta) = \\cos(-\\theta)$ (an even function).\n\n* If the angle $\\theta$ corresponds to a point $(x,y)$ on the unit circle, then rotating by $\\pi$ moves the points to $(-x, -y)$. So $\\cos(\\theta) = x = - \\cos(\\theta + \\pi)$, and $\\sin(\\theta) = y = -\\sin(\\theta + \\pi)$.\n\n\n* If the angle $\\theta$ corresponds to a point $(x,y)$ on the unit circle, then rotating by $\\pi/2$ moves the points to $(-y, x)$. So $\\cos(\\theta) = x = \\sin(\\theta + \\pi/2)$.\n\n\n\n\nThe fact that $x^2 + y^2 = 1$ for the unit circle leads to the\n\"Pythagorean identity\" for trigonometric functions:\n\n$$~\n\\sin(\\theta)^2 + \\cos(\\theta)^2 = 1.\n~$$\n\nThis basic fact can be manipulated many ways.

        "### Functions using degrees\n\nTrigonometric function are functions of angles which have two common descriptions: in terms of degrees or radians. Degrees are common when right triangles are considered, radians much more common in general, as the relationship with arc-length holds in that $r\\theta = l$, where $r$ is the radius of a circle and $l$ the length of the arc formed by angle $\\theta$.\n\nThe two are related, as a circle of $2\\pi$ radians and 360 degrees. So to convert from degrees into radians it takes multiplying by $2\\pi/360$ and to convert from radians to degrees it takes multiplying by $360/(2\\pi)$. The `deg2rad` and `rad2deg` functions are available for this task.\n\n\nIn `Julia`, the functions `sind`, `cosd`, `tand`, `cscd`, `secd`, and `cotd` are available to simplify the task of composing the two operations (that is `sin(deg2rad(x))` is the same as `sind(x)`).\n\n## The sum-and-difference formulas\n\nConsider the point on the unit circle $(x,y) = (\\cos(\\theta), \\sin(\\theta))$. In terms of $(x,y)$ (or $\\theta$) is there a way to represent the angle found by rotating an additional $\\theta$, that is what is $(\\cos(2\\theta), \\sin(2\\theta))$?\n\nMore generally, suppose we have two angles $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$, can we\nrepresent the values of $(\\cos(\\alpha + \\beta), \\sin(\\alpha + \\beta))$\nusing the values just involving $\\beta$ and $\\alpha$ separately?\n\nAccording to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometric_functions#Identities) the following figure (from [mathalino.com](http://www.mathalino.com/reviewer/derivation-of-formulas/derivation-of-sum-and-difference-of-two-angles)) has ideas that date to Ptolemy:"

In fact, the Pythagorean identify is often used to rewrite this, for example $\\cos(2\\alpha) = 2\\cos(\\alpha)^2 - 1$ or $1 - 2\\sin(\\alpha)^2$.\n\n\nApplying the above with $\\alpha = \\beta/2$, we get that $\\cos(\\beta) = 2\\cos(\\beta/2)^2 -1$, which rearranged yields the \"half-angle\" formula: $\\cos(\\beta/2)^2 = (1 + \\cos(\\beta))/2$.\n\n\n##### Example\n\nConsider the expressions $\\cos((n+1)\\theta)$ and $\\cos((n-1)\\theta)$. These can be re-expressed as:\n\n$$~\n\\begin{align}\n\\cos((n+1)\\theta) &= \\cos(n\\theta + \\theta) = \\cos(n\\theta) \\cos(\\theta) - \\sin(n\\theta)\\sin(\\theta), \\text{ and}\\\\\n\\cos((n-1)\\theta) &= \\cos(n\\theta - \\theta) = \\cos(n\\theta) \\cos(-\\theta) - \\sin(n\\theta)\\sin(-\\theta).\n\\end{align}\n~$$\n\nBut $\\cos(-\\theta) = \\cos(\\theta)$, whereas $\\sin(-\\theta) = -\\sin(\\theta)$. Using this, we add the two formulas above to get:\n\n$$~\n\\cos((n+1)\\theta) = 2\\cos(n\\theta) \\cos(\\theta)  - \\cos((n-1)\\theta).\n~$$\n\nThat is the angle for a multiple of $n+1$ can be expressed in terms of the angle with a multiple of $n$ and $n-1$. This can be used recursively to find expressions for $\\cos(n\\theta)$ in terms of polynomials in $\\cos(\\theta)$.\n\n## Inverse trigonometric functions\n\nThe  trigonometric functions are all periodic. In particular they are not monotonic over their entire domain. This means there is no *inverse* function applicable. However, by restricting the domain to where the functions are monotonic, inverse functions can be defined:\n\n* For $\\sin(x)$, the restricted domain of $[-\\pi/2, \\pi/2]$ allows for the arcsine function to be defined. In `Julia` this is implemented with `asin`.\n\n* For $\\cos(x)$, the restricted domain of $[0,\\pi]$ allows for the arccosine function to be defined. In `Julia` this is implemented with `acos`.\n\n* For $\\tan(x)$, the restricted domain of $(-\\pi/2, \\pi/2)$ allows for the arctangent function to be defined. In `Julia` this is implemented with `atan`.\n\n\nFor example, the arcsine function is defined for $-1 \\leq x \\leq 1$ and has a range of $-\\pi/2$ to $\\pi/2$:"

Click through to\nsee a ray of light passing through a spherical drop of water, as analyzed by Descartes. The\ndeflection of the ray occurs when the incident light hits the drop of\nwater, then there is an *internal* deflection of the light, and\nfinally when the light leaves, there is another deflection. The total\ndeflection (in radians) is $D = (i-r) + (\\pi - 2r) + (i-r) = \\pi - 2i - 4r$. However, the incident angle $i$ and the refracted angle $r$ are related by Snell's law: $\\sin(i) = n \\sin(r)$. The value $n$ is the index of refraction and is $4/3$ for water. (It was $3/2$ for glass in the previous example.) This gives\n\n$$~\nD = \\pi + 2i - 4 \\arcsin(\\frac{1}{n} \\sin(i)).\n~$$\n\nGraphing this for incident angles between $0$ and $\\pi/2$ we have:"

        "(Using calculus it can be seen to be $\\arccos(((n^2-1)/3)^{1/2})$.)\n\n##### Example: The Chebyshev Polynomials\n\nConsider again this equation derived with the sum-and-difference formula:\n\n\n$$~\n\\cos((n+1)\\theta) = 2\\cos(n\\theta) \\cos(\\theta)  - \\cos((n-1)\\theta).\n~$$\n\nLet $T_n(x) = \\cos(n \\arccos(x))$. Calling $\\theta = \\arccos(x)$ for $-1 \\leq x \\leq x$ we get a relation between these functions:\n\n$$~\nT_{n+1}(x) = 2x T_n(x) - T_{n-1}(x).\n~$$\n\nWe can simplify a few: For example, when $n=0$ we see immediately that $T_0(x) = 1$, the constant function. Whereas with $n=1$ we get $T_1(x) = \\cos(\\arccos(x)) = x$. Things get more interesting as we get bigger $n$, for example using the equation above we get $T_2(x) = 2xT_1(x) - T_0(x) = 2x\\cdot x - 1 = 2x^2 - 1$. Continuing, we'd get $T_3(x) = 2 x T_2(x) - T_1(x) = 2x(2x^2 - 1) - x = 4x^3 -3x$.\n\nA few things become clear from the above two representations:\n\n* Starting from $T_0(x) = 1$ and $T_1(x)=x$ and using the recursive defintion of $T_{n+1}$ we get a family of polynomials where $T_n(x)$ is a degree $n$ polynomial. These are defined for all $x$, not just $-1 \\leq x \\leq 1$.\n\n* Using the initial definition, we see that the zeros of $T_n(x)$ all occur within $[-1,1]$ and happen when $n\\arccos(x) = k\\pi + \\pi/2$, or $x=\\cos((2k+1)/n \\cdot \\pi/2)$ for $k=0, 1, \\dots, n-1$.\n\nOther properties of this polynomial family are not at all obvious. One is that amongst all polynomials of degree $n$ with roots in $[-1,1]$, $T_n(x)$ will be the smallest in magnitude (after we divide by the leading coefficient to make all polynomials considered to be monic). We can check this for one case. Take $n=4$, then we have: $T_4(x) = 8x^4 - 8x^2 + 1$. Compare this with $q(x) = (x+3/5)(x+1/5)(x-1/5)(x-3/5)$ (evenly spaced zeros):"
