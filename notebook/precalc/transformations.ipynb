        "Thinking of functions as objects themselves that can be\nmanipulated - rather than just blackboxes for evaluation - is a major\nabstraction of calculus. The main operations to come: the limit *of a\nfunction*, the derivative *of a function*, and the integral *of a\nfunction* all operate on functions. Hence the idea of an\n[operator](http://tinyurl.com/n5gp6mf). Here we discuss manipulations of functions from pre-calculus that have proven\nto be useful abstractions.\n\n## The algebra of functions\n\nWe can talk about the algebra of functions. For example, the sum of functions $f$ and $g$ would be a function whose value at $x$ was just $f(x) + g(x)$. More formally, we would have:\n\n$$\n(f + g)(x) = f(x) + g(x),\n$$\n\nWe have given meaning to a new function $f+g$ by defining what is does\nto $x$ with the rule on the right hand side. Similarly, we can define\noperations for subtraction, multiplication, addition, and\npowers. These aren't defined in base `Julia`, though they could be if\ndesired, by a commands such as:"

        "Doing this works, as Julia treats functions as first class objects,\nlending itself to\n[higher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_programming) order\nprogramming. However, this definition in general is kind of limiting,\nas functions in mathematics and Julia can be much more varied than\njust the univariate functions we have defined addition for. We won't\npursue this further.\n\n## Composition of functions\n\nAs seen, just like with numbers, it can make sense mathematically to define addition,\nsubtraction, multiplication and division of functions. Unlike numbers though,\nwe can also define a new operation on functions called **composition**\nthat involves chaining the output of one function to the input of\nanother.  Composition is a common practice in life, where the result\nof some act is fed into another process. For example, making a pie\nfrom scratch involves first making a crust, then composing this with a\nfilling. A better abstraction might be how we \"surf\" the web. The\noutput of one search leads us to another search whose output then is a\ncomposition.\n\nMathematically, a composition of univariate functions $f$ and $g$ is\nwritten $f \\circ g$ and defined by what it does to a value in the\ndomain of $g$ by:\n\n$$\n(f \\circ g)(x) = f(g(x)).\n$$\n\nThe output of $g$ becomes the input of $f$.\n\nComposition depends on the order of things. There is no guarantee that\n$f \\circ g$ should be the same as $g \\circ f$. (Putting on socks then\nshoes is quite different from putting on shoes then socks.) Mathematically, we can see\nthis quite clearly with the functions $f(x) = x^2$ and $g(x) =\n\\sin(x)$. Algebraically we have:\n\n$$\n(f \\circ g)(x) = \\sin(x)^2, \\quad (g \\circ f)(x) = \\sin(x^2).\n$$\n\nThough they may be *typographically* similar don't be fooled, the following\ngraph shows that the two functions aren't even close except for $x$\nnear $0$ (for example, one composition is always non-negative, whereas\nthe other is not):"
