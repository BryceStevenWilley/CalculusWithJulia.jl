The `return` key will send a command to the interpreter and the results are displayed in the REPL terminal.\n\nThe REPL has many features for editing, for interacting with the package manager, or interaction with the shell. However it is command-line based, which no support for mouse interaction. For that, other options are available.\n\n\n## `IJulia`\n\n\"Project [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/)  exists to develop open-source software, open-standards, and services for interactive computing across dozens of programming languages.\" The `IJulia` package allows `Julia` to be one of these programming languages. This package must be installed prior to use.\n\nThe Jupyter Project provides two web-based interfaces to `Julia`: the Jupyter notebook and the newer JupyterLab. The [juliabox](https://www.juliabox.com/) project and the [binder](https://mybinder.org/) project use Juptyer notebooks for their primary interface to `Julia`.\n\nIf not installed, these interfaces are available once `IJulia` is installed.

        "The notes have blocks of commands, as though they are entered in a notebook.\n\n\nIn `IJulia`, a block of commands is sent to the kernel (the `Julia` interpreter) by typing \"shift+return\" or clicking on a \"run\" button. The output is printed below a cell, including graphics.\n\nWhen a cell is evaluating, the leading `[]` has an asterick (`[*]`) showing the notebook is awaiting the results of the calculation.\n\nOnce a cell is evaluated, the leading `[]` has a number inserted (e.g., `[1]`, as in the figure). This number indicates the order of cell evaluation. Once a notebook is interacted with, the state of the namespace need not reflect the top-to-bottom order of the notebook, but rather reflects the order of cell evaluations.\n\nTo be specific, a variable like `x` may be redefined in a cell above where the variable is intially defined and this redefinition will hold the current value known to the interpreter. As well, a notebook, when reloaded, may have unevaluated cells with output showing. These will not influence the state of the kernel until they are evaluated.\n\nWhen a cell's commands are evaluated, the last command executed is displayed. If it is desirable that multiple values be displayed, they can be packed into a tuple. This is done by using commas to separate values. `IJulia` will also display other means to print output (e.g., `@show`, `display`, `print`, ...).\n\nTo run all cells in a notebook from top to bottom, the \"run all\" command under the \"Cell\" menu is available.\n\nIf a calculation takes much longer than anticipated, the \"kernel\" can be interrupted through a menu item of \"Kernel\".\n\nIf the kernal appears unresponsive, it can be restarted through  a menu item of \"Kernel\".\n\nNotebooks can be saved (as `*.ipynb` files) for sharing or for reuse. Notebooks can be printed at HTML pages, and if the proper underlying software is available, as formatted pages.\n\n----\n\nJupyterLab has more features, commonly associated with an integrated development environment (IDE)."

Juno is based on the cross-platform, javascript-based [Atom](https://atom.io/) editor and provides interfaces for the repl, graphics, help pages, debugging, project management, etc. Atom was developed by GitHub, since acquired by Microsoft.\n\n\n### VSCode\n\nThe [VS Code](https://github.com/julia-vscode/julia-vscode) extension provides support for the julia programming language for [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). VS Code is an open-sourced code editor supported by Microsoft. Similar to `Juno`, VS Code provides a cross-platform interface to `Julia` geared towards programming within the language."
