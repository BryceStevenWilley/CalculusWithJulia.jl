        "The technique of $u$-[substitution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_by_substitution) is derived from reversing the chain rule: $[f(g(x))]' = f'(g(x)) g'(x)$.\n\nSuppose that $g$ and $u'(x)$ are integrable functions. Then both these integrals are defined:\n\n$$~\n\\int_a^b g(u(t)) \\cdot u'(t) dt, \\quad \\text{and}\\quad \\int_{u(a)}^{u(b)} g(x) dx.\n~$$\n\nWe wish to show they are equal.\n\nLet $G$ be an antiderivative of $g$, which exists as $g$ is assumed to be continuous. (By the Fundamental Theorem part I.) Consider the composition $G \\circ u$. The chain rule gives:\n\n$$~\n[G \\circ u]'(t) = G'(u(t)) \\cdot u'(t) = g(u(t)) \\cdot u'(t).\n~$$\n\nSo,\n\n$$~\n\\begin{align}\n\\int_a^b g(u(t)) \\cdot u'(t) dt &= \\int_a^b (G \\circ u)'(t) dt\\\\\n&= (G\\circ u)(b) - (G\\circ u)(a) \\quad\\text{(the FTC, part II)}\\\\\n&= G(u(b)) - G(u(a)) \\\\\n&= \\int_{u(a)}^{u(b)} g(x) dx. \\quad\\text{(the FTC part II)}\n\\end{align}\n~$$\n\n\nThat is, this substitution formula applies:\n\n> $$~ \\int_a^b g(u(x)) u'(x) dx = \\int_{u(a)}^{u(b)} g(x) dx. ~$$\n\nWe have seen a special case of substitution where $u(x) = x-c$ in the formula $\\int_{a-c}^{b-c} g(x) dx= \\int_a^b g(x-c)dx$.\n\n\n\nThe main use of this is to take complicated things inside of the function $g$ out of the function (the $u(x)$) by renaming them, then account for the change of name.\n\nSome examples are in order.\n\nConsider:\n\n$$~\n\\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\cos(x) e^{\\sin(x)} dx.\n~$$\n\nClearly the $\\sin(x)$ inside the exponential is an issue. If we let $u(x) = \\sin(x)$, then $u'(x) = \\cos(x)$, and this becomes\n\n$$~\n\\int_{u(0)}^{u(\\pi/2)} e^x dx = e^x \\big|_{\\sin(0)}^{\\sin(\\pi/2)} = e^1 - e^0.\n~$$\n\nThis all worked as the problem was such that it was more or less obvious what to choose for $u$ and $G$.\n\n### \"u\" substitution\n\nThe process of identifying the result of the chain rule in the\nfunction to integrate is not automatic, but rather a bit of an art. The basic\nstep is to try some values. Typically, this is taught by\n\"substituting\" in some value for part of the expression (basically the\n$u(x)$) and seeing what happens.\n\nIn the above problem, $\\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\cos(x) e^{\\sin(x)} dx$, we\nmight just rename $\\sin(x)$ to be $u$ (suppressing the \"of $x$\npart). Then we need to rewrite the \"$dx$\" part of the integral. We\nknow in this case that $du/dx = \\cos(x)$. In terms of differentials,\nthis gives $du = \\cos(x) dx$. But this allows us to substitute in with\n$u$ and $du$ as is possible:\n\n$$~\n\\int_0^{\\pi/2} \\cos(x) e^{\\sin(x)} dx = \\int_0^{\\pi/2}  e^{\\sin(x)} \\cdot \\cos(x) dx = \\int_{u(0)}^{u(\\pi)} e^u du.\n~$$\n\n----\n\nLet's illustrate with a new problem: $\\int_0^2 4x e^{x^2} dx$.\n\nAgain, we see that the $x^2$ inside the exponential is a complication. Letting $u = x^2$ we have $du = 2x dx$. We  have $4xdx$ in the\noriginal problem, so we will end up with $2du$:\n\n$$~\n\\int_0^2 4x e^{x^2} dx = 2\\int_0^2 e^{x^2} \\cdot 2x dx = 2\\int_{u(0)}^{u(2)} e^u du = 2 \\int_0^4 e^u du =\n2 e^u\\big|_{u=0}^4 = 2(e^4 - 1).\n~$$\n\n----\n\nConsider now $\\int_0^1 2x^2 \\sqrt{1 + x^3} dx$. Here we see that the $1 + x^3$ makes the square root term complicated. If we call this $u$, then what is $du$? Clearly, $du = 3x^2 dx$, or $(1/3)du = x^2 dx$, so we can rewrite this as:\n\n$$~\n\\int_0^1 2x^2 \\sqrt{1 + x^3} dx = \\int_{u(0)}^{u(1)} 2 \\sqrt{u} (1/3) du = 2/3 \\cdot \\frac{u^{3/2}}{3/2} \\big|_1^2 =\n\\frac{4}{9} \\cdot(2^{3/2} - 1).\n~$$\n\n\n----\n\nConsider $\\int_0^{\\pi} \\cos(x)^3 \\sin(x) dx$. The $\\cos(x)$ function inside the $x^3$ function is complicated. We let $u(x) = \\cos(x)$ and see what that implies: $du = \\sin(x) dx$, which we see is part of the question. So the above becomes:\n\n$$~\n\\int_0^{\\pi} \\cos(x)^3 \\sin(x) dx = \\int_{u(0)}^{u(\\pi)} u^3 du= \\frac{u^4}{4}\\big|_0^0 = 0.\n~$$\n\nChanging limits leaves the two endpoints the same, which means the\ntotal area after substitution is $0$. A graph of this function shows\nthat about $\\pi/2$ the function has odd-like symmetry, so the answer of $0$ is supported by the plot:"

        "----\n\nConsider $\\int_1^e \\log(x)/x dx$. There isn't really an \"inside\" function here, but instead just a tricky $\\log(x)$. If we let $u=\\log(x)$, what happens? We get $du = 1/x \\cdot dx$, which we see present in the original. So with this, we have:\n\n$$~\n\\int_1^e \\frac{\\log(x)}{x} dx = \\int_{u(1)}^{u(e)} u du = \\frac{u^2}{2}\\big|_0^1 = \\frac{1}{2}.\n~$$\n\n##### Example: Transformations\n\nWe say that the area intrinsically discussed in the definite integral\n$A=\\int_a^b f(x-c) dx$ is unaffected by shifts, in that $A =\n\\int_{a-c}^{b-c} f(x) dx$. What about more general transformations?\nFor example: if $g(x) = (1/h) \\cdot f((x-c)/h)$ for values $c$ and $h$ what is\nthe integral over $a$ to $b$ in terms of the function $f(x)$?\n\nIf $A = \\int_a^b (1/h) \\cdot f((x-c)/h) dx$ then we let $u = (x-c)/h$. With this, $du = 1/h \\cdot dx$. This allows a straight substitution:\n\n$$~\nA = \\int_a^b \\frac{1}{h} f(\\frac{x-c}{h}) dx = \\int_{(a-c)/h}^{(b-c)/h} f(u) du.\n~$$\n\nSo the answer is: the area under the transformed function over $a$ to $b$\nis the area of the function over the transformed region.\n\n\nFor example, consider the \"hat\" function $f(x) = 1 - \\lvert x \\rvert $\nwhen $-1 \\leq x \\leq 1$ and $0$ otherwise. The area under $f$ is just\n$1$ - the graph forms a triangle with base of length $2$ and height\n$1$. If we take any values of $c$ and $h$, what do we find for the\narea under the curve of the transformed function?\n\nLet $u(x) = (x-c)/h$ and $g(x) = h f(u(x))$. Then, as $du = 1/h dx$\n\n$$~\n\\begin{align}\n\\int_{c-h}^{c+h} g(x) dx\n&= \\int_{c-h}^{c+h} h f(u(x)) dx\\\\\n&= \\int_{u(c-h)}^{u(c+h)} f(u) du\\\\\n&= \\int_{-1}^1 f(u) du\\\\\n&= 1.\n\\end{align}\n~$$\n\nSo the area of this transformed function is still $1$. The shifting by\n$c$ we know doesn't effect the area, the scaling by $h$ inside of $f$\ndoes, but is balanced out by the multiplication by $h$ outside of $f$.\n\n##### Example: Speed versus velocity\n\nThe \"velocity\" of an object includes a sense of direction in addition to the sense of magnitude. The \"speed\" just includes the sense of magnitude. Speed is always non-negative, whereas velocity is a signed quantity.\n\nAs mentioned previously, position is the integral of velocity, as expressed precisely through this equation:\n\n$$~\nx(t) = \\int_0^t v(u) du - x(0).\n~$$\n\nWhat is the integral of speed?\n\nIf $v(t)$ is the velocity, the $s(t) = \\lvert v(t) \\rvert$ is the speed. If integrating either $s(t)$ or $v(t)$, the  integrals would agree when $v(t) \\geq 0$. However,  when $v(t) \\leq 0$, the position back tracks so $x(t)$ decreases, where the integral of $s(t)$ would only increase.\n\nThis integral\n\n$$~\ntd(t) = \\int_0^t s(u) du = \\int_0^t \\lvert v(u) \\rvert du,\n~$$\n\nGives the *total distance* traveled.\n\nTo illustrate with a simple example, if a car drives East for one hour\nat 60 miles per hour, then heads back West for an hour at 60 miles per\nhour, the car's position after one hour is $x(2) = x(0)$, with a change in position $x(2) - x(0) = 0$. Whereas, the\ntotal distance traveled is $120$ miles. (Gas is paid on total\ndistance, not change in position!). What are the formulas for speed\nand velocity? Clearly $s(t) = 60$, a constant, whereas here $v(t) =\n60$ for $0 \\leq t \\leq 1$ and $-60$ for $1 < t \\leq 2$.\n\n\n\nSuppose $v(t)$ is given by $v(t) = (t-2)^3/3 - 4(t-2)/3$. If $x(0)=0$\nFind the position after 3 time units and the total distance traveled.\n\n\nWe let $u(t) = t - 2$ so $du=dt$. The position is given by\n\n$$~\n\\int_0^3  ((t-2)^3/3 - 4(t-2)/3) dt = \\int_{u(0)}^{u(3)} (u^3/3 - 4/3 u) du =\n(\\frac{u^4}{12} - \\frac{4}{3}\\frac{u^2}{2}) \\big|_{-2}^1 = \\frac{3}{4}.\n~$$\n\nThe speed is similar, but we have to work harder:\n\n\n$$~\n\\int_0^3 \\lvert v(t) \\rvert dt = \\int_0^3  \\lvert ((t-2)^3/3 - 4(t-2)/3) \\rvert dt  =\n\\int_{-2}^1 \\lvert u^3/3 - 4u/3 \\rvert du.\n~$$\n\nBut $u^3/3 - 4u/3 = (1/3) \\cdot u(u-1)(u+2)$, so between $-2$ and $0$\nit is positive and between $0$ and $1$ negative, so this integral is:\n\n$$~\n\\int_{-2}^0 (u^3/3 - 4u/3 ) du + \\int_{0}^1 -(u^3/3 - 4u/3) du =\n(\\frac{u^4}{12} - \\frac{4}{3}\\frac{u^2}{2}) \\big|_{-2}^0 - (\\frac{u^4}{12} - \\frac{4}{3}\\frac{u^2}{2}) \\big|_{0}^1 = \\frac{4}{3} - -\\frac{7}{12} = \\frac{23}{12}.\n~$$\n\n## SymPy and substitution\n\nThe `integrate` function in `SymPy` can handle most problems which involve substitution. Here are a few examples:\n\n\n* This integral, $\\int_0^2 4x/\\sqrt{x^2 +1}dx$, involves a substitution for $x^2 + 1$:"

        "## Trigonometric substitution\n\nWait, in the last example an antiderivative for $\\sqrt{1 + u^2}$ was found. But how? We haven't discussed this yet.\n\n\nThis can be found using *trigonometric* substitution. In this example,\nwe know that $1 + \\tan(\\theta)^2$ simplifies to $\\sec(\\theta)^2$, so\nwe might *try* a substitution of $\\tan(u)=x$. This would simplify\n$\\sqrt{1 + x^2}$ to $\\sqrt{1 + \\tan(u)^2} = \\sqrt{\\sec(u)^2}$ which is\n$\\lvert \\sec(u) \\rvert$. What of $du$? The chain rule gives\n$\\sec(u)^2du = dx$. In short we get:\n\n$$~\n\\int \\sqrt{1 + x^2} dx = \\int \\sec(u)^2 \\lvert \\sec(u) \\rvert du = \\int \\sec(u)^3 du\n~$$\n\n\nThis leaves still the question of integrating $\\sec(u)^3$, which we aren't (yet) prepared to discuss, but we see that this type of substitution can re-express an integral in a new way that may pay off.\n\n##### Examples\n\nLet's see some examples where a trigonometric substitution is all that is needed.\n\nConsider $\\int 1/(1+x^2) dx$. This is an antiderivative of some function, but if that isn't observed, we might notice the $1+x^2$ and try to simplify that. First, an attempt at a $u$-substitution:\n\n\nLetting $u = 1+x^2$ we get $du = 2xdx$ which gives $\\int 1/u (2x) du$. We aren't able to address the \"$2x$\" part successfully, so this attempt is for naught.\n\n\nNow we try the trigonometric substitution taking advantage of $1+\\tan(x)^2 = \\sec(x)^2$. Letting $\\tan(u) = x$ yields $\\sec(u)^2 du = dx$ and we get:\n\n$$~\n\\int \\frac{1}{1+x^2} dx = \\int \\frac{1}{1 + \\tan(u)^2} \\sec(u)^2 du = \\int 1 du = u.\n~$$\n\nBut $\\tan(u) = x$, so in terms of $x$, an antiderivative is just $\\tan^{-1}(x)$, or the arctangent.
