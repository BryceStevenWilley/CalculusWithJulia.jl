        "The length of the jump rope in the picture can be computed by either looking at the packaging it came in, or measuring the length of each plastic segment and multiplying by the number of segments. The former is easier, the latter provides the intuition as to how we can find the length of curves in the $x-y$ plane. The idea is old, [Archimedes](http://www.maa.org/external_archive/joma/Volume7/Aktumen/Polygon.html) used fixed length segments of polygons to approximate $\\pi$ using the circumference of circle producing the bounds $3~\\frac{1}{7} > \\pi > 3~\\frac{10}{71}$.\n\nA more modern application is the algorithm used by GPS devices to record a path taken. However, rather than record times for a fixed distance traveled, the GPS device records position ($(x,y)$ or longitude and latitude at fixed units of time - similar to how parametric functions are used. The device can then compute distance traveled and speed traveled using some familiar formulas.\n\n## Arc length formula\n\nRecall the distance formula gives the distance between two points: $\\sqrt{(x_1 - x_0)^2 + (y_1 - y_0)^2}$.\n\nConsider now two functions $g(t)$ and $f(t)$ and the parameterized\ngraph between $a$ and $b$ given by the points $(g(t), f(t))$ for $a\n\\leq t \\leq b$. Assume that both $g$ and $f$ are differentiable on\n$(a,b)$ and continuous on $[a,b]$ and furthermore that $\\sqrt{f'(t) +\ng'(t)}$ is Riemann integrable.\n\n\n> **The arc length of a curve**. For $f$ and $g$ as described, the arc length of the parameterized curve is given by\n> $$~ L = \\int_a^b \\sqrt{g'(t) + f'(t)} dt. ~$$ For the special case of the graph of a function $f(x)$ between $a$ and $b$ the formula becomes $L = \\int_a^b \\sqrt{ 1 + f'(x)} dx$ (taking $g(t) = t$)."

(It is commented that this was\nalso known a bit earlier by von Heurat.) Gregory went further though,\nas part of the fundamental theorem of calculus was contained in his\nwork.  Gregory then posed this inverse question: given a curve\n$y=g(x)$ find a function $u(x)$ so that the area under $g$ is equal to\nthe length of the second curve. The answer given was $u(x) =\n(1/c)\\int_a^x \\sqrt{g^2(t) - c^2}$, which if $g(t) = \\sqrt{1 + f'(t)}$\nand $c=1$ says $u(x) = \\int_a^x f(t)dt$.\n\nAn analogy might be a sausage maker. These take a mass of ground-up sausage material and return a long length of sausage. The material going in would depend on time via an equation like $\\int_0^t g(u) du$ and the length coming out would be a constant (accounting for the cross section) times $u(t) = \\int_0^t \\sqrt{1 + g'(s)} ds$.\n\n\"\"\")"

A new parameterization is provided by $\\gamma(t)$. Suppose $\\gamma$ is strictly increasing, so that an inverse function exists. (This assumption is implicitly made by the teacher, as it implies the student won't start counting in the wrong direction.) Then the same curve is described by composition through $(g(\\gamma(u)), f(\\gamma(u)))$ $\\gamma^{-1}(a) \\leq u \\leq \\gamma^{-1}(b)$. That the arc length is the same follows from substitution:\n\n$$~\n\\begin{align}\n\\int_{\\gamma^{-1}(a)}^{\\gamma^{-1}(b)} \\sqrt{([g(\\gamma(t))]')^2 + ([f(\\gamma(t))]')^2} dt\n&=\\int_{\\gamma^{-1}(a)}^{\\gamma^{-1}(b)} \\sqrt{(g'(\\gamma(t) )\\gamma'(t))^2 + (f'(\\gamma(t) )\\gamma'(t))^2 } dt \\\\\n&=\\int_{\\gamma^{-1}(a)}^{\\gamma^{-1}(b)} \\sqrt{g'(\\gamma(t))^2 + f'(\\gamma(t))^2} \\gamma'(t) dt\\\\\n&=\\int_a^b \\sqrt{g'(u)^2 + f'(u)^2} du = L\n\\end{align}\n~$$\n\n(Using $u=\\gamma(t)$ for the substitution.)\n\nIn traveling there are two natural parameterizations: one by time, as in \"how long have we been driving?\"; and the other by distance, as in \"how  far have we been driving?\" Parameterizing by distance, or more technically arc length has other mathematical advantages.\n\nTo parameterize by arc length, we just need to consider a special $\\gamma$ defined by:\n\n$$~\n\\gamma(u) = \\int_0^u \\sqrt{g'(t)^2 + f'(t)^2} dt.\n~$$\n\nSupposing $\\sqrt{g'(t)^2 + f'(t)^2}$ is continuous and positive, This\ntransformation is increasing, as its derivative by the Fundamental\nTheorem of Calculus is $\\sqrt{g'(t)^2 + f'(t)^2}$, which by assumption\nis positive. (It is certainly non-negative.) So there exists an inverse\nfunction. That it exists is one thing, computing all of this is a\ndifferent matter, of course.\n\nFor a simple example, we have $g(t) = R\\cos(t)$ and $f(t)=R\\sin(t)$\nparameterizing the circle of radius $R$. The arc length between $0$\nand $t$ is simply $\\gamma(t) = Rt$, which we can easily see from the\nformula.  The inverse of this function is $\\gamma^{-1}(u) = u/R$, so\nwe get the parameterization $(g(Rt), f(Rt))$ for $0/R \\leq t \\leq\n2\\pi/R$.\n\nWhat looks at first glance to be just a slightly more complicated equation is that of an ellipse, with $g(t) = a\\cos(t)$ and $f(t) = b\\sin(t)$. Taking $a=1$ and $b = a + c$, for $c > 0$ we get the equation for the arc length as a function of $t$ is just\n\n$$~\ns(u) = \\int_0^u \\sqrt{(-\\sin(t))^2 + b\\cos(t)^2} dt = \\int_0^u \\sqrt{\\sin(t))^2 + \\cos(t)^2 + c\\cos(t)^2} dt =\n\\int_0^u \\sqrt{1 + c\\cos(t)^2} dt.\n~$$\n\nBut, despite it not being too daunting, this integral is not tractable through our techniques and has an answer involving elliptic integrals. We can work numerically though. Letting $a=1$ and $b=2$, we have the arc length is given by:"
