        "Let $f(x)$ be a continuous function over the interval $[a,b]$ with $a < b$.\n\nThe average value of $f$ over $[a,b]$ is defined by:\n\n$$~\n\\frac{1}{b-a} \\int_a^b f(x) dx.\n~$$\n\nIf $f$ is a constant, this is just the contant value, as would be\nexpected. If $f$ is *piecewise* linear, then this is the weighted\naverage of these constants.\n\n## Examples\n\n##### Average velocity\n\nThe average velocity between times $a < b$, is simply the\nchange in position during the time interval divided by the change in\ntime. In notation, this would be $(x(b) - x(a)) / (b-a)$. If $v(t) =\nx'(t)$ is the velocity, then by the second part of the fundamental\ntheorem of calculus, we have, in agreement with the definition above,\nthat:\n\n$$~\n\\text{average velocity} = \\frac{x(b) - x(a)}{b-a} = \\frac{1}{b-a} \\int_a^b v(t) dt.\n~$$\n\n\nThe average speed is the change in *total* distance over time, which is given by\n\n$$~\n\\text{average speed} =  \\frac{1}{b-a} \\int_a^b \\lvert v(t)\\rvert dt.\n~$$\n\n\n\nLet $\\bar{v}$ be the average velocity. Then we have $\\bar{v}\n\\cdot(b-a) = x(b) - x(a)$, or the change in position can be written as\na constant ($\\bar{v}$) times the time, as though we had a constant\nvelocity.  This is an old intuition.\n[Bressoud](http://www.math.harvard.edu/~knill/teaching/math1a_2011/exhibits/bressoud/)\ncomments on the special case known to scholars at Merton\nCollege around 1350 that the distance traveled by an object under\nuniformly increasing velocity starting at $v_0$ and ending at $v_t$ is\nequal to the distance traveled by an object with constant velocity of\n$(v_0 + v_t)/2$.\n\n##### Example\n\nWhat is the average value of $f(x)=\\sin(x)$ over $[0, \\pi]$?\n\n$$~\n\\text{average} = \\frac{1}{\\pi-0} \\int_0^\\pi \\sin(x) dx = \\frac{1}{\\pi} (-\\cos(x)) \\big|_0^\\pi = \\frac{2}{\\pi}\n~$$\n\nVisually, we have:"

        "## The mean value theorem for integrals\n\nIf $f(x)$ is assumed integrable, the average value of $f(x)$ is\ndefined, as above. Re-expressing gives that there exists a $K$ with\n\n$$~\nK \\cdot (b-a) = \\int_a^b f(x) dx.\n~$$\n\nWhen we assume that $f(x)$ is continuous, we can describe $K$ as a value in the range of $f$:\n\n> **The mean value theorem for integrals**: Let $f(x)$ be a continuous\n> function on $[a,b]$ with $a < b$. Then there exists $c$ with $a \\leq c \\leq b$ with\n> $$~ f(c) \\cdot (b-a) = \\int_a^b f(x) dx.~$$\n\nThe proof comes from the intermediate value theorem and the extreme\nvalue theorem. Since $f$ is continuous on a closed interval, there\nexists values $m$ and $M$ with $f(c_m) = m \\leq f(x) \\leq M=f(c_M)$,\nfor some $c_m$ and $c_M$ in the interval $[a,b]$. Since $m \\leq f(x) \\leq M$, we must have:\n\n$$~\nm \\cdot (b-a) \\leq K\\cdot(b-a) \\leq M\\cdot(b-a).\n~$$\n\nSo in particular $K$ is in $[m, M]$. But $m$ and $M$ correspond to\nvalues of $f(x)$, so by the intermediate value theorem, $K=f(c)$ for\nsome $c$ that must lie in between $c_m$ and $c_M$, which means as well\nthat it must be in $[a,b]$.\n\n##### Proof of second part of Fundamental Theorem of Calculus\n\nThe mean value theorem is exactly what is needed to prove formally the\nsecond part of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. Again, suppose\n$f(x)$ is continuous on $[a,b]$ with $a < b$. For any $a < x < b$, we\ndefine $F(x) = \\int_a^x f(u) du$. Then the derivative of $F$ is $f$.\n\nLet $h>0$. Then consider the forward difference $(F(x+h) -\nF(x))/h$. Rewriting gives:\n\n$$~\n\\frac{\\int_a^{x+h} f(u) du - \\int_a^x f(u) du}{h}  =\\frac{\\int_x^{x+h} f(u) du}{h} = f(\\xi(h)).\n~$$\n\nThe value $\\xi(h)$ is just the $c$ corresponding to a given value in $[x, x+h]$\nguaranteed by the mean value theorem.  We only know that $x \\leq \\xi(h) \\leq x+h$. But\nthis is plenty - it says that $\\lim_{h \\rightarrow 0+} \\xi(h) =\nx$. Using the fact that $f$ is continuous and the known properties of\nlimits of compositions of functions this gives $\\lim_{h \\rightarrow\n0+} f(\\xi(h)) = f(x)$. But this means that the (right) limit of the\nsecant line expression exists and is equal to $f(x)$, which is what we\nwant to prove. Repeating a similar argument when $h < 0$, finishes the proof.\n\n\nThe basic notion used is simply that for small $h$, this expression is well\napproximated by the left Riemann sum taken over $[x, x+h]$:\n\n$$~\nf(\\xi(h)) \\cdot h = \\int_x^{x+h} f(u) du.\n~$$\n\n## Questions\n\n###### Question\n\nBetween $0$ and $1$ a function is constantly $1$. Between $1$ and $2$ the function is constantly $2$. What is the average value of the function over the interval $[0,2]$?"
