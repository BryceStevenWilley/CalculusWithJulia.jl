A very hot summer may\nmake walking around in a heavy costume quite uncomfortable.\n\nA back-of-the envelope calculation would start by\n\n* Mentally separating out each \"tire\" and lining them up one by one.\n\n* Counting the number of \"tires\" (or rings), say $n$.\n\n* Estimating the radius for each tire, say $r_i$ for $1 \\leq i \\leq n$.\n\n* Estimating the height for each tire, say $h_i$ for $1 \\leq i \\leq n$\n\nThen the volume would be found by adding:\n\n$$~\nV = \\pi \\cdot r_1^2 \\cdot h_1 + \\pi \\cdot r_2^2 \\cdot h_2 + \\cdot + \\pi \\cdot r_n^2 \\cdot h_n.\n~$$\n\nThe weight would come by multiplying the volume by some appropriate density.\n\nLooking at the sum though, we see the makings of an approximate\nintegral. If the heights were to get infinitely small, we might expect\nthis to approach something like $V=\\int_a^b \\pi r(h)^2  dh$.\n\nIn fact, we have in general\n\n> **Volume of a figure with a known cross section**: The volume of a solid with known cross-sectional\n> area $CA(x)$ from $x=a$ to $x=b$ is given by\n> $$~ V = \\int_a^b CA(x) dx. ~$$\n> This assumes $CA(x)$ is integrable.\n\nThis formula is derived by approximating the volume by \"slabs\" with\nvolume $CA(x) \\Delta x$ and using the Riemann integral's definition to\npass to the limit.

If every plane parallel to these two planes intersects both\nregions in cross-sections of equal area, then the two regions have\nequal volumes.\" (Wikipedia).\n\n\nWith the formula for the volume of solids based on cross sections,\nthis is a trivial observation, as the functions giving the\ncross-sectional area are identical. Still, it can be surprising.\nConsider a sphere with an interior cylinder bored out of it.  (The\n[Napkin](http://tinyurl.com/o237v83) ring problem.)

        "The small orange line is rotated, so using the washer method we get the cross sections given by $\\pi(r_o^2 - r_i^2)$, the outer and inner radii, as a function of $y$.\n\nThe outer radii has points $(x,y)$ satisfying $x^2 + y^2 = R^2$, so is $\\sqrt{R^2 - y^2}$. The inner radii has a constant value, and as indicated in the figure, is $\\sqrt{R^2 - (h/2)^2}$, by the Pythagorean theorem.\n\nThus the cross sectional area is\n\n$$~\n\\pi( (\\sqrt{R^2 - y^2})^2 - (\\sqrt{R^2 - (h/2)^2})^2 )\n= \\pi ((R^2 - y^2) - (R^2 - (h/2)^2))\n= \\pi ((\\frac{h}{2})^2 - y^2)\n~$$\n\nAs this does not depend on $R$, and the limits of integration would\nalways be $-h/2$ to $h/2$ by Cavalieri's principle, the volume of the\nsolid will be independent of $R$ too.\n\nTo actually compute this volume, we take $R=h/2$, so that the bore\nhole is just a line of no volume, the resulting volume is then that of\na sphere with radius $h/2$, or $4/3\\pi(h/2)^3 = \\pi h^3/6$.\n\n## Pappus theorem (2nd)\n\nThe second theorem of [Pappus](http://tinyurl.com/l43vw4) say that if\na plane figure $F$ is rotated around an axis to form a solid of\nrevolution, the total volume can be written as $2\\pi r A(F)$, where\n$r$ is the distance the centroid is from the axis of revolution, and\n$A(F)$ is the area of the plane figure. In short, the distance\ntraveled by the centroid times the area.\n\nThis can make some computations trivial. For example, we can make\na torus (or donut) by rotating the circle $(x-2)^2 + y^2 = 1$ about the\n$y$ axis. As the centroid is clearly $(2, 0)$, with $r=2$ in the above\nformula, and the area of the circle is $\\pi 1^2$, the volume of the\ndonut is $2\\pi(2)(\\pi) = 4\\pi^2$.\n\n##### Example\n\nAbove, we found the volume of cone, as it is a solid of revolution,\nthrough the general formula. However, parameterizing the cone as the\nrevolution of a triangle with vertices $(0,0)$, $(r, 0)$, and $(0,h)$\nand using the formula for the center of mass in the $x$ direction of\nsuch a triangle, $r/3$, we get that the volume of a cone with\nheight $h$ and radius $r$ is just $2\\pi (r/3)\\cdot (rh/2) = \\pi r^2 h/3$.\n\n## Questions\n\n###### Question\n\n\nConsider this big Solo cup:"
